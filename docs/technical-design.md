## 0. The one-page version

We are building a Slack-like team messaging app for 5–50-person technical teams, where the source of truth is an **append-only event log** and every rendering surface is a **rebuildable projection** of it. A self-hosted **sync server** validates, sequences, stores, and fans out events; clients replicate per-stream and render locally.

**The layering rule that governs everything** (resolves the design doc's web-vs-local-first tension):

> **Local-first *architecture* is universal. Local-first *storage* is per-platform.**
>
> - The *protocol* — client-generated event IDs, per-stream cursors, idempotent upload, outbox, projection rebuild — applies to every client.
> - The *files* — NDJSON logs, SQLite, "workspace is a folder" — exist on the **server** (as the export format) and later on the **desktop client** (Tauri, M6). The MVP **web client is online-first**: IndexedDB cache + outbox, no SQLite-WASM, no browser NDJSON, no airplane-mode promise.

**Locked decisions** (rationale in the assessment; do not relitigate during implementation):

| # | Decision |
|---|----------|
| D1 | Event envelope split into **hashed client body** + **unhashed server metadata**; canonicalization = **RFC 8785 (JCS)**; **no `prev_event_hash`**; `signature` reserved null |
| D2 | **Per-stream `server_sequence`** + one `workspace-meta` stream per workspace; `GET /v1/sync` returns stream heads |
| D3 | Three message classes: **durable events** (log), **synced per-user state** (read markers, prefs — KV API), **ephemeral signals** (presence/typing — WebSocket only, never stored) |
| D4 | Web client: **online-first**, Dexie/IndexedDB cache, outbox, SharedWorker-owned WebSocket |
| D5 | Stack: **FastAPI + Postgres** (single uvicorn process), **Vue 3 + TS + Pinia + Tailwind + TipTap** |
| D6 | Auth: argon2id + opaque per-device session tokens + single-use invite links; **no JWT, no SMTP dependency** |
| D7 | Threads: `thread_root_id` on `message.created`, same stream (Slack model) |
| D8 | Attachments: content-addressed blobs on **local disk**, download authorized via `file_id` → membership, **never by hash**; no GC in MVP; size/quota caps |
| D9 | Event schema evolution: per-type versions, additive-only, unknown types preserved-but-skipped; projection version bump ⇒ rebuild |
| D10 | Search: **server-side Postgres FTS** for MVP; client FTS5 arrives with desktop |
| D11 | Export format: **NDJSON per stream per month** + content-addressed blobs + `manifest.json` |
| D12 | Plugins: server-side only, out-of-process, webhook-shaped, Slack-compatible incoming payloads |
| D13 | Stream access requires **current membership**; removal cuts all server-side history access; local copies are not retractable (documented property) |
| D14 | Ordering and display timestamps derive from **server sequence / server time only**; `client_created_at` is untrusted metadata |

Two deployed containers: `app` and `postgres`. Blobs live on a bind-mounted volume. **One uvicorn worker** — WebSocket fanout is an in-process registry; this constraint is documented in the compose file and revisited only when a real workspace outgrows it.

```

The `core/` event library is written once in Python and consumed by both server and CLI. The web client re-implements only the envelope construction + hashing (small, spec-tested against shared JSON test vectors in `core/testdata/` — both implementations must pass the same vectors).

---

## 2. Event model

### 2.1 Envelope: client body vs. server metadata

An event as stored and transmitted has two sections. **`event_hash` = SHA-256 over the RFC 8785 (JCS) canonicalization of the `body` object only.** The server never mutates `body`; everything the server knows goes in `server`.

```json
{
  "body": {
    "event_id": "01JZ7N6A4M6Y8W5K2H7DGKX4PA",
    "workspace_id": "w_01JZ...",
    "stream_id": "s_01JZ...",
    "type": "message.created",
    "type_version": 1,
    "author_user_id": "u_01JZ...",
    "author_device_id": "d_01JZ...",
    "client_created_at": "2026-07-04T18:22:10.123Z",
    "payload": {
      "message_id": "m_01JZ...",
      "text": "Hello everyone",
      "format": "markdown",
      "thread_root_id": null,
      "file_ids": [],
      "mentions": ["u_01JZ..."]
    }
  },
  "event_hash": "sha256:9f2c...",
  "signature": null,
  "server": {
    "server_sequence": 9284,
    "server_received_at": "2026-07-04T18:22:10.456Z",
    "payload_redacted": false
  }
}
```

Rules:

- `event_id` is a **ULID** minted by the client (sortable, offline-safe). All entity IDs (`u_`, `s_`, `m_`, `f_`, `d_`, `w_` + ULID) are client- or server-minted ULIDs with type prefixes.
- `signature` is **reserved, always null in MVP**. When device keys arrive (federation era), it signs `event_hash`. No `prev_event_hash` anywhere (assessment §3.4).
- `server.payload_redacted` is **reserved for post-MVP redaction**: the server may null `body.payload` and set this true; redacted events are exempt from hash verification. The field ships now so exports and clients handle it from day one.
- **`client_created_at` is untrusted** (D14). It may be displayed as "composed at" detail; all ordering, display timestamps, and "new since" logic use `server_sequence` and `server_received_at`.
- Max serialized event size: **64 KB** (hard reject at upload).

### 2.2 MVP event types

All flow through the same envelope; `payload` schemas are Pydantic models in `core/` (mirrored as JSON Schema in `docs/schemas/` for the web client and plugin authors).

**Channel/DM streams:**

| Type | Payload (required fields) | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `message.created` | `message_id`, `text`, `format`, `thread_root_id?`, `file_ids?`, `mentions?` | First reply to a root message *is* thread creation; no `thread.created` type |
| `message.edited` | `message_id`, `text`, `mentions?` | LWW by server order; history retained |
| `message.deleted` | `message_id` | Tombstone; projection hides |
| `reaction.added` | `message_id`, `emoji` | Idempotent on `(message_id, author_user_id, emoji)` |
| `reaction.removed` | `message_id`, `emoji` | Idempotent remove |
| `pin.added` / `pin.removed` | `message_id` | |
| `file.uploaded` | `file_id`, `sha256`, `name`, `mime_type`, `size_bytes` | Emitted after blob upload confirmed (§6) |

**`workspace-meta` stream** (one per workspace; every member is subscribed):

| Type | Payload | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `workspace.created` | `name` | First event, sequence 1 |
| `user.joined` / `user.left` | `user_id`, `display_name?` | Workspace membership |
| `user.profile_updated` | `user_id`, changed fields | |
| `channel.created` | `channel_stream_id`, `name`, `visibility` (`public`/`private`) | |
| `channel.renamed` / `channel.archived` | `channel_stream_id`, … | |
| `channel.member_added` / `channel.member_removed` | `channel_stream_id`, `user_id` | Only these events grant/revoke private-channel access |
| `dm.created` | `dm_stream_id`, `member_user_ids` | DM/group-DM streams are created lazily on first message |
| `bot.installed` / `bot.removed` | `bot_user_id`, `name`, `scopes` | Plugin-era (M5) |

Membership events for **private** channels are visible in `workspace-meta` only to members of that channel? **No — simpler MVP rule:** private channel lifecycle events go into the **private channel's own stream**, not `workspace-meta`; `workspace-meta` carries only public-channel and workspace-level events. This keeps `workspace-meta` universally readable with zero filtering. (Consequence: a user's list of private channels is learned from `GET /v1/sync`, which only returns streams they can read.)

### 2.3 Schema evolution contract (D9)

1. `type_version` is **per event type**, starting at 1.
2. Within a version, changes are **additive-only**; all readers ignore unknown fields.
3. Unknown event *types* (or versions above a reader's max): **preserve in log/cache, skip in projection, never crash.** This is what lets old clients coexist with new servers.
4. Breaking change ⇒ increment `type_version`; the server may up-convert old versions at read time; clients send `max_supported_versions` at WebSocket connect (map of type → version) — the server uses it only for telemetry in MVP.
5. Every projection (server and client) declares a `PROJECTION_VERSION`. Bumping it forces a rebuild from the log/cache. **`rebuild` is a first-class, tested operation from M0 onward** — it is the escape hatch for every projection bug.

### 2.4 Conflict semantics (unchanged from design doc §12)

- Message creation: no conflict.
- Reactions: idempotent set ops keyed `(message_id, user_id, emoji)`.
- Edits: last write wins by `server_sequence`; prior payloads remain in the log (edit history UI reads them).
- Deletes: tombstones.
- Concurrent offline edits: server order decides; no merge UI in MVP.

---

## 3. Streams, sequencing, and the sync protocol

### 3.1 Streams and sequences (D2)

- A **stream** is the unit of ordering, permissioning, and sync: one per channel, one per DM/group-DM, one `workspace-meta` per workspace.
- The server assigns a **gapless, monotonically increasing `server_sequence` per stream** at accept time (Postgres: `UPDATE streams SET head_seq = head_seq + 1 ... RETURNING head_seq` inside the insert transaction — trivially correct under concurrency at this scale).
- **Client guarantee: per-stream sequences visible to an authorized member have no gaps.** A gap means data loss, not permissions — this is the integrity property per-workspace sequencing would have destroyed.

### 3.2 HTTP API

All endpoints under `/v1`, authenticated by `Authorization: Bearer <session_token>` (§7). Errors are RFC 9457 problem+json.

**`POST /v1/events/batch`** — upload client events.

```jsonc
// request
{ "events": [ { "body": {...}, "event_hash": "sha256:..." } ] }   // ≤ 100 events, ≤ 1 MB total
// response 200
{
  "accepted": [ { "event_id": "01JZ...", "stream_id": "s_...", "server_sequence": 9284, "server_received_at": "..." } ],
  "rejected": [ { "event_id": "01JZ...", "code": "permission_denied" | "invalid_schema" | "hash_mismatch" | "payload_too_large" | "unknown_stream", "detail": "..." } ]
}
```

- **Idempotency:** `event_id` is unique per workspace (Postgres unique index). A re-upload of an already-accepted event returns the *original* accepted record (same sequence), not an error and not a duplicate. This makes the client outbox a dumb retry loop.
- Validation order: session → workspace membership → stream write permission → schema (type + version) → `event_hash` recomputation (JCS) → payload referential checks (e.g., `file_ids` exist and were uploaded by this user; `message_id` exists for reactions/edits — or the event is rejected, no "pending reference" support in MVP) → size caps.
- Author fields (`author_user_id`, `author_device_id`) must match the session; mismatch ⇒ reject. Bot tokens (M5) may author only as their bot user.

**`GET /v1/sync`** — reconnect bootstrap.

```jsonc
// response: every stream the caller can currently read
{
  "streams": [
    { "stream_id": "s_meta...", "kind": "workspace-meta", "head_seq": 4102 },
    { "stream_id": "s_gen...",  "kind": "channel", "name": "general", "visibility": "public", "head_seq": 9284, "member": true },
    { "stream_id": "s_dm1...",  "kind": "dm", "member_user_ids": ["u_a","u_b"], "head_seq": 121 }
  ]
}
```

One round trip tells a reconnecting client exactly what to pull. Public channels the user hasn't joined appear (for the channel browser) with `member: false`.

**`GET /v1/events?stream_id=…&after=N&limit=500`** — forward catch-up (cursor pull).
**`GET /v1/events?stream_id=…&before=N&limit=500`** — **backward backfill** for cold start and scrollback: newest page first, lazily walk history. Both return `{ "events": [...], "has_more": bool }` in ascending sequence order within the page.

**Cold-start rule (assessment §3.14):** a new device does *not* replay full history. It pulls `GET /v1/sync`, then for each visible stream fetches the newest page (`before=head+1`), renders immediately, and backfills on scroll. `workspace-meta` alone is always synced from sequence 1 (it is small and the client needs full channel/member state).

**Other endpoints** (specified in their sections): `/v1/auth/*`, `/v1/read-state`, `/v1/prefs`, `/v1/files/*`, `/v1/search`, `/v1/admin/*`, `/v1/plugins/*`, `/v1/export`.

### 3.3 WebSocket

`GET /v1/ws?token=…` — one socket per client (per SharedWorker). Messages are JSON frames:

**Server → client:**
- `{"t": "event", "event": {envelope}}` — a newly sequenced event on a stream the connection's user can read. Fanout is permission-scoped at send time: the hub resolves recipients from the in-memory membership map (invalidated by membership events).
- `{"t": "read_state", "stream_id": ..., "last_read_seq": ...}` — another device of the same user moved a read marker.
- `{"t": "presence", "user_id": ..., "state": "active"|"away"|"offline"}`
- `{"t": "typing", "stream_id": ..., "user_id": ...}` — server relays, TTL 5 s, client-side expiry.

**Client → server:**
- `{"t": "typing", "stream_id": ...}` (rate-limited 1/3 s per stream)
- `{"t": "presence", "state": "active"|"away"}`
- `{"t": "ping"}` / server `{"t": "pong"}` — 30 s heartbeat; missed heartbeats close the socket.

**Delivery contract:** WebSocket push is an optimization, not the source of truth. The client treats frames as hints and trusts only cursors: on every (re)connect it runs `GET /v1/sync` + catch-up pulls; any pushed event with `server_sequence != cursor + 1` for its stream triggers a pull for that stream instead of blind application. This one rule eliminates the entire class of missed/duplicate-push bugs.

### 3.4 The three message classes (D3)

| Class | Examples | Store | Transport | In export? |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **Durable events** | messages, reactions, edits, membership | Postgres `events` (+ client caches) | batch upload / pull / WS push | **Yes** |
| **Synced per-user state** | read markers, notification prefs | Postgres KV tables | `PUT/GET /v1/read-state`, `/v1/prefs` + WS echo to own devices | No |
| **Ephemeral signals** | presence, typing | in-memory only | WebSocket frames | No |

Anything new must be assigned to a class before it is built. "Is this an event?" is answered by: *would it belong in a 30-year archive of the workspace?*

### 3.5 Read state and unread counts (assessment §3.5)

```
PUT /v1/read-state          { "stream_id": "s_...", "last_read_seq": 9280 }
GET /v1/read-state          → [ { "stream_id": ..., "last_read_seq": ..., "updated_at": ... } ]
```

- Server stores `(user_id, stream_id) → last_read_seq` (monotonic: a PUT with a lower seq is ignored).
- Unread badge = `head_seq − last_read_seq` (client computes from its projection; server computes for the sidebar bootstrap payload).
- Mention badges: client projection indexes `payload.mentions` at apply time; a mention with `seq > last_read_seq` sets the red badge. No server round trip.
- Notification preferences (per-stream: `all` / `mentions` / `mute`) use the same shape: `PUT/GET /v1/prefs`.

### 3.6 Permissions (D13)

Roles: `owner`, `admin`, `member`, `guest` (workspace) — `guest` sees only streams they're explicitly added to. Stream-level: membership set per private channel/DM; public channels are readable/writable by all non-guest members (join = subscribe, but reading a public channel doesn't require joining).

Enforcement points (each independently tested):
1. **Upload:** write permission on the target stream.
2. **Pull (`/v1/events`, `/v1/sync`):** current read permission; non-member of a private stream gets `404` (not `403` — existence is not disclosed).
3. **WebSocket fanout:** recipient set recomputed on membership events.
4. **Files (§6):** via `file_id` → stream → membership.
5. **Search:** filtered by readable streams in the query itself.

Removal from a private channel cuts server-side access to *all* of its history immediately (Slack semantics). Already-synced local copies are not retractable — this is documented user-facing behavior, inherent to local-first.

---

## 4. Server design

### 4.1 Stack

Python 3.12, FastAPI, uvicorn (**one worker**), SQLAlchemy 2 async + asyncpg, Alembic migrations, Pydantic v2 for all payload schemas, `argon2-cffi`, `rfc8785` (or vendored ~100-line JCS implementation with test vectors). No Redis, no queue, no Celery — background work (webhook delivery, export jobs) uses `asyncio` tasks in-process.

### 4.2 Postgres schema (core tables)

```sql

```

Accept path for one event (single transaction): validate → `SELECT ... FOR UPDATE` on the stream row → `head_seq + 1` → insert into `events` → apply to `messages_proj` → commit → hand to WS hub for fanout. On `UNIQUE (workspace_id, event_id)` violation: fetch and return the original accepted record (idempotent path).

**Server-side projections follow the same rebuild contract as clients:** `msgctl rebuild-projections` truncates `messages_proj` and replays `events`. CI runs it and diffs against incremental state (M0 exit criterion, kept forever).

### 4.3 Operational guardrails

| Guardrail | Value (config-overridable) |
|---|---|
| Max event size | 64 KB |
| Max batch | 100 events / 1 MB |
| Rate limit: events per user | 60/min sustained, burst 20/s |
| Rate limit: auth attempts | 10/min per IP + per email |
| Max file size | 100 MB |
| Per-workspace file quota | 10 GiB default |
| WS connections per user | 10 |
| Pull page size | ≤ 500 events |

**Backups:** everything lives in two places — the Postgres volume and the blob directory. Documented story: `pg_dump` + rsync of `blobs/`, or snapshot the single data directory; *and* `msgctl export` produces the portable NDJSON workspace folder, which is itself a full logical backup. Restore = import.

**Observability:** structured JSON logs (uvicorn + app), `/healthz` (DB ping), `/metrics` (Prometheus text: event throughput, WS connection count, fanout latency). OpenTelemetry deferred.

---

## 5. Web client design

### 5.1 Architecture (D4)

Vue 3 + TypeScript + Pinia + Tailwind + TipTap (composer). Vite build, served by the FastAPI app (single origin — no CORS, cookies stay simple).

**SharedWorker owns all shared mutable state** (assessment §3.14): the WebSocket, the Dexie (IndexedDB) database, the sync engine, and the outbox. Tabs are dumb views: they talk to the worker over `postMessage` RPC (query projections, subscribe to stream updates, enqueue sends). Fallback for browsers without SharedWorker (Safari < 16): Web Locks leader election, same interface. This is built in M2, not retrofitted.

### 5.2 Dexie schema

```ts
// db.ts — PROJECTION_VERSION guards all derived tables
events:      "[stream_id+server_sequence], event_id, type"   // raw envelopes (cache, evictable)
messages:    "message_id, stream_id, [stream_id+created_seq], thread_root_id"
streams:     "stream_id, kind"                               // + name, visibility, head_seq, member
cursors:     "stream_id"                                     // last_contiguous_seq, oldest_loaded_seq
outbox:      "event_id, created_at"                          // body + state: queued|sending|rejected
read_state:  "stream_id"                                     // last_read_seq (local echo of server KV)
meta:        "key"                                           // projection_version, session info, my user_id
```

- The cache is **bounded**: per stream keep the newest ~2,000 events; older pages are re-fetched via `before=` on scroll. Eviction never touches `outbox`.
- `PROJECTION_VERSION` mismatch on boot ⇒ drop derived tables, re-apply from cached `events`, then resume pulls (the client-side `rebuild`).
- IndexedDB absence/failure (private browsing) degrades gracefully: in-memory cache, everything still works online.

### 5.3 Sync engine (in the worker)

State machine per connection: `connecting → syncing → live → degraded(offline)`.

1. On connect: `GET /v1/sync` → diff heads against local cursors → parallel catch-up pulls (`after=`) for behind streams; new streams get newest-page pulls (`before=`).
2. `live`: apply WS `event` frames; **any sequence discontinuity ⇒ targeted pull** (§3.3 delivery contract).
3. Outbox drain loop: oldest-first, `POST /v1/events/batch`, exponential backoff (1 s → 30 s cap, jitter); on `accepted` → move event from outbox into `events`/projection with its real sequence; on `rejected` → mark the message failed in-UI (retry/delete affordance). Drain runs whenever connectivity resumes — a message composed during a Wi-Fi blip sends itself.
4. **Send path is optimistic:** composer → build envelope + hash in worker → insert into projection as `pending` (renders instantly, greyed timestamp) → enqueue outbox. On ack, the message settles into server order; because pending messages render at the bottom and acks arrive in seconds, reordering jank is minimal by construction.

### 5.4 UX surfaces (M2–M3)

- **Sidebar:** channels (unread bold, mention badge), DMs, presence dots; instant channel switching (projection reads, no network).
- **Message list:** virtualized scroll, day dividers, backward pagination on scroll-top, edit/delete affordances, reactions with picker, hover toolbar.
- **Composer (TipTap):** markdown shortcuts, `@mention` autocomplete (fed from workspace-meta projection), file drag-drop/paste, Enter-to-send / Shift-Enter newline, edit-last-message on ArrowUp.
- **Threads:** right-hand panel (Slack model); root messages show reply count/participants from projection.
- **Notifications:** in-app badges + tab-title count + `Notification` API (permission-gated) for mentions/DMs while the app is open, respecting per-stream prefs. Web Push = M3 stretch, not blocking.
- **Search:** search box → `GET /v1/search?q=…&in=…&from=…` (server FTS), results panel with jump-to-context (jump = targeted `before/after` pulls around the hit).
- **Keyboard:** Cmd+K switcher (fuzzy channel/DM/user), Alt+↑/↓ unread channel nav, Esc marks read. The switcher ships in M2 — it is cheap and defines the "fast" feel.

## 6. Attachments (D8)

Upload (server-proxied in MVP — no presigned URLs until S3 backend exists):

```
1. client: sha256(file) locally
2. POST /v1/files/initiate { sha256, name, mime_type, size_bytes, stream_id }
     → { file_id, upload_needed: bool }        // authz: write access to stream_id; quota + size checked here
3. if upload_needed: PUT /v1/files/{file_id}/blob   (streaming body; server verifies sha256 while writing)
4. client emits file.uploaded event, then message.created with file_ids
```

- Blob store: local disk `blobs/sha256/ab/abcd1234…`, behind a `BlobStore` interface (`put/get/exists/delete`) so S3/MinIO is a config change later.
- **Download authz by `file_id` only** (`GET /v1/files/{file_id}` → membership check on its stream → stream response). Raw hashes are never a URL. Dedup (`upload_needed: false`) is only revealed *after* the caller passed authz and quota checks for creating a file record.
- Orphaned blobs (initiated, never attached): kept in MVP; `files.stream_id` null marks them. Post-MVP GC design (written now, built later): refcount = live `files` rows per sha256; sweep unreferenced blobs older than 30 days via `msgctl gc`.
- Image files get server-generated thumbnails (Pillow, max 720 px, stored as derived blobs) — M3, needed for a Slack-feel message list.

---

## 7. Auth, identity, invites (D6)

- **Registration:** first user on a fresh server creates the workspace and becomes `owner` (guided by `msgctl init` or first-run web flow). Everyone else joins via invite link.
- **Invites:** `POST /v1/admin/invites { role, ttl }` → single-use URL `https://host/join/<token>` (token random 256-bit, stored hashed). Acceptance page collects email + display name + password → creates user, marks invite used, emits `user.joined` to `workspace-meta`. SMTP is **optional** (config for "email this link"); the link itself is the mechanism.
- **Login:** `POST /v1/auth/login { email, password, device_label }` → argon2id verify → mint `device_id` (per browser install, persisted in IndexedDB `meta`; reused on re-login) → mint opaque session token (random 256-bit; stored **hashed**; returned once) → client stores it in worker-held memory + IndexedDB. Rolling 90-day expiry, `last_seen_at` updated on use.
- **Revocation:** sessions list + revoke in user settings (`DELETE /v1/auth/sessions/{id}`); instant, because every request hits the sessions table (indexed PK lookup — no measurable cost at this scale). This is why **no JWT**.
- Password reset: admin-issued reset link in MVP (same machinery as invites). Self-serve email reset arrives with optional SMTP.
- `devices.public_key` reserved null — device signing keys are federation-era.

---

## 8. Search (D10)

`GET /v1/search?q=…&in=<stream_id>&from=<user_id>&before=<date>&after=<date>&limit=25&cursor=…`

- Postgres FTS over `messages_proj.search_tsv`, joined against the caller's readable-streams set (same predicate as `/v1/events` authz — one shared SQL fragment, tested once).
- `websearch_to_tsquery` for Google-ish syntax; rank by `ts_rank_cd`, tie-break recency. Deleted/redacted messages excluded.
- Filter grammar parsed client-side into query params (`from:@dana in:#general before:2026-07-01`).
- Known MVP limits (documented, accepted): English stemming config, no attachment content indexing, no fuzzy match. Desktop FTS5 and/or server upgrade path (pg_trgm, Meilisearch) post-MVP.

---

## 9. Export / import (D11)

**Export** (`msgctl export <dir>` or `GET /v1/export` as tar stream, admin-only):

```text
workspace-export/
  manifest.json          # format_version, workspace meta, stream index (id→kind/name/head_seq),
                         # blob index (sha256 → size, referencing file_ids), event counts, export time
  streams/
    <stream_id>/
      2026-07.ndjson     # full envelopes (body + server metadata), ascending server_sequence
  blobs/
    sha256/ab/abcd1234...
  users.json             # user/profile snapshot (no password hashes)
```

- One NDJSON line = one full envelope exactly as served by the API. Keyed by `stream_id`, never by name (rename-safe). Month split by `server_received_at`.
- **Verification:** `msgctl verify <dir>` recomputes every `event_hash` (JCS over `body`), checks per-stream sequence contiguity, and re-hashes every blob. This command is the ownership pitch made testable.
- **Import** (`msgctl import <dir>` into an empty server): replays envelopes preserving sequences, restores blobs, rebuilds projections. Round-trip test (`export → import → export` byte-identical modulo timestamps) is M4's exit criterion.
- Private streams and DMs are included — export is a server-admin operation and the export is the whole workspace. (Per-user export: post-MVP.)

---

## 10. Plugins (M5, D12)

- **Incoming webhooks:** `POST /v1/hooks/<hook_token>` accepting the Slack-compatible shape (`{"text": …, "blocks"?: …}` — text + a small supported subset), producing a `message.created` authored by the hook's bot user in its configured channel. This makes every existing "post to Slack" integration work day one.
- **Outgoing subscriptions:** registration record `{plugin_id, name, url, secret, event_types[], stream_ids[]|all-public}`. Server POSTs matching envelopes (HMAC-SHA256 signature header, 5 s timeout, 3 retries with backoff, auto-disable after 100 consecutive failures + admin notification). At-least-once delivery; consumers dedupe by `event_id`.
- **Bot users:** `is_bot=true`, no password; auth via scoped tokens (`events:write:<stream>`, `events:read:<stream>`, `files:write`). Bot-authored events are flagged in UI by authorship (no envelope change needed).
- Explicitly not in MVP: in-process/WASM plugin runtime, slash-command framework (a bot can implement commands by reading messages), plugin marketplace.

## 11. Deployment

```yaml
# docker-compose.yml
services:
  app:
    image: msg/server            # multi-stage build: web dist baked into the Python image
    ports: ["8080:8080"]
    environment:
      MSG_DATABASE_URL: postgresql+asyncpg://msg:${POSTGRES_PASSWORD}@postgres/msg
      MSG_DATA_DIR: /data        # blobs live here
      MSG_SECRET_KEY: ${MSG_SECRET_KEY}
    volumes: [ "./data:/data" ]
    depends_on: [ postgres ]
    # NOTE: exactly one app container / one uvicorn worker.
    # WebSocket fanout is in-process; horizontal scaling requires a shared
    # pub/sub layer (deliberately out of scope for MVP).
  postgres:
    image: postgres:17
    environment: { POSTGRES_DB: msg, POSTGRES_USER: msg, POSTGRES_PASSWORD: ${POSTGRES_PASSWORD} }
    volumes: [ "./postgres:/var/lib/postgresql/data" ]
```

Two services, no MinIO, no Redis (assessment §4/§28). TLS via the operator's reverse proxy (Caddy/nginx/Traefik — documented recipe with Caddy, since it's two lines and auto-HTTPS). Alembic migrations run on app startup. `msgctl` ships inside the image (`docker compose exec app msgctl …`).

## 12. Testing strategy

**The M2 acceptance suite is the project's go/no-go gate.** Property-based simulation tests (`hypothesis` + `pytest`) drive N simulated clients against a real server instance (in-process ASGI + ephemeral Postgres via `testcontainers`), with randomized interleavings of: sends, edits, reactions, disconnects mid-request, retries, reconnects, membership changes. Invariants asserted after every run:

1. **Idempotency:** duplicate uploads never create duplicate events; retried mid-flight sends converge to exactly one accepted event.
2. **Convergence:** all clients' projections are byte-identical to each other and to a fresh rebuild-from-pull.
3. **Cursor integrity:** reconnect after arbitrary missed events yields gapless, duplicate-free per-stream sequences.
4. **Permission isolation:** a client without membership observes zero private-stream data via pull, sync heads, search, files, or WS fanout — asserted by a dedicated "adversary client" in every simulation run.
5. **Pending settling:** optimistic messages end in correct server order with no lost/duplicated renders (asserted at the projection layer; visual jank is a manual QA item).
6. **Rebuild equivalence:** dropping projections and replaying equals incremental state — client (Dexie) and server (`messages_proj`) both.

Plus: unit tests for JCS/hashing against shared cross-language test vectors (`core/testdata/vectors.json` — Python and TS must both pass); schema round-trip tests per event type/version; API contract tests from the OpenAPI schema; Playwright smoke for the golden path (login → send → reload → history intact → second browser sees message live).

## 13. Milestones

Sized for ~1 engineer + AI tooling; each milestone has a hard exit criterion.

| # | Scope | Exit criterion |
|---|---|---|
| **M0 — Protocol spike** (1 wk) | `core/` envelope + JCS + hashing; `msgctl` appends `message.created` to NDJSON, projects to SQLite, `rebuild`, `verify` | Rebuild ≡ incremental, hash vectors frozen, envelope schema locked for TDD §2 |
| **M1 — Sync server** (3 wk) | Auth/sessions/invites, streams + membership, `workspace-meta`, batch upload w/ per-stream sequencing + idempotency, pull (`after`/`before`), `/v1/sync`, WS push w/ scoped fanout, Postgres schema + migrations, compose file | Two `msgctl`-driven clients converge over the real server; simulation suite skeleton green |
| **M2 — Web client + sync proof** (3 wk) | Vue shell: login, sidebar, message list, composer; SharedWorker + Dexie cache + cursors + outbox; reconnect catch-up; pending→acked settling; Cmd+K switcher | **All six §12 invariants green in CI.** Hard gate: no M3 work until they pass |
| **M3 — Slack-like core** (5 wk) | Threads, reactions, edits/deletes, mentions + notifications (in-app/tab/Notification API), read-state + unread badges, presence/typing, file upload/download + thumbnails, server search, channel & member management UI | **Dogfood gate: builders use msg as their only team chat for 2 weeks** |
| **M4 — Portability** (1–2 wk) | `export` / `import` / `verify` (NDJSON + blobs + manifest) | Round-trip export→import→export identical; verify green on dogfood workspace |
| **M5 — Plugins** (2 wk) | Incoming Slack-compatible webhooks, outgoing subscriptions, bot tokens; GitHub notifier as reference plugin | GitHub PR events posting into dogfood workspace via the public plugin API only |
| **M6 — Desktop (Tauri)** | Same Vue app in Tauri; real SQLite + FTS5 projection, NDJSON logs on disk, true offline, local search | "Workspace is a folder" demo: kill network, full app works; folder passes `msgctl verify` |

Cut entirely: federation experiment (design doc M6). The envelope reserves what federation needs (`signature`, origin fields, content hashes); building it earns nothing before the product has users.

**Post-MVP backlog (designed-not-built, in priority order):** Web Push notifications · blob GC (`msgctl gc`) · redaction mechanism (`payload_redacted`) · Slack import · per-user export · self-serve password reset via SMTP · S3 blob backend · mobile.

---

## 14. Risks

| Risk | Mitigation |
|---|---|
| UX worse than Slack despite sound architecture (design doc §25.1 — the #1 risk) | M3 dogfood gate is mandatory; composer/switcher/unread polish are milestone line items, not "later"; virtualized list + optimistic sends from day one |
| Sync bugs erode trust (lost/duplicated/reordered messages) | §12 simulation suite as CI gate before features; delivery contract (§3.3) makes push safe-by-construction; idempotent outbox |
| Single-process fanout ceiling | Documented constraint; at 5–50 users the ceiling is far away; the protocol is process-count-agnostic, so a pub/sub layer or Go sync-path port slots in without protocol changes |
| Scope creep toward federation/E2EE/offline-web | This TDD's cut lines (D-table, §13 cuts) are the contract; changes require revising this doc, not drive-by PRs |
| Export format becomes stale vestige | `verify` in CI against dogfood data from M4 onward; export is the backup story, so it stays load-bearing |
| Solo-builder bus factor / stall in the 5-week M3 | M3 is decomposed into independently shippable features gated on M2's frozen protocol; each lands behind the dogfood instance |

---

## 15. Deviations from the design doc (for the record)

All adopted from the tech-lead assessment: per-stream sequencing replaces per-workspace (§11.4 reversed) · `prev_event_hash` dropped, `signature` reserved · envelope split into hashed body + server metadata · web MVP is online-first (no browser NDJSON/SQLite-WASM); full offline moves to desktop M6 · server-side search replaces client FTS5 for MVP · MinIO cut from compose · `thread.created` event removed · unread/presence/typing designed as non-event classes · milestone order reworked (server before web UI; portability before plugins; federation cut). Everything else implements the design doc as written.
