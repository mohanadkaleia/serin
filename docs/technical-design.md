## 0. The one-page version

We are building a modern team messaging app for 5–50-person technical teams, where the source of truth is an **append-only event log** and every rendering surface is a **rebuildable projection** of it. A self-hosted **sync server** validates, sequences, stores, and fans out events; clients replicate per-stream and render locally.

**The layering rule that governs everything** (resolves the design doc's web-vs-local-first tension):

> **Local-first *architecture* is universal. Local-first *storage* is per-platform.**
>
> - The *protocol* — client-generated event IDs, per-stream cursors, idempotent upload, outbox, projection rebuild — applies to every client.
> - The *files* — NDJSON logs, SQLite, "workspace is a folder" — exist on the **server** (as the export format) and later on the **desktop client** (Tauri, M6). The MVP **web client is online-first**: IndexedDB cache + outbox, no SQLite-WASM, no browser NDJSON, no airplane-mode promise.

**Locked decisions** (rationale in the assessment; do not relitigate during implementation):

| # | Decision |
|---|----------|
| D1 | Event envelope split into **hashed client body** + **unhashed server metadata**; canonicalization = **RFC 8785 (JCS)**; **no `prev_event_hash`**; `signature` reserved null |
| D2 | **Per-stream `server_sequence`** + one `workspace-meta` stream per workspace; `GET /v1/sync` returns stream heads |
| D3 | Three message classes: **durable events** (log), **synced per-user state** (read markers, prefs — KV API), **ephemeral signals** (presence/typing — WebSocket only, never stored) |
| D4 | Web client: **online-first**, Dexie/IndexedDB cache, outbox, SharedWorker-owned WebSocket |
| D5 | Stack: **FastAPI + Postgres** (single uvicorn process), **Vue 3 + TS + Pinia + Tailwind + TipTap** |
| D6 | Auth: argon2id + opaque per-device session tokens + single-use invite links; **no JWT, no SMTP dependency** |
| D7 | Threads: `thread_root_id` on `message.created`, same stream (flat-channel thread model) |
| D8 | Attachments: content-addressed blobs on **local disk**, download authorized via `file_id` → membership, **never by hash**; no GC in MVP; size/quota caps |
| D9 | Event schema evolution: per-type versions, additive-only, unknown types preserved-but-skipped; projection version bump ⇒ rebuild |
| D10 | Search: **server-side Postgres FTS** for MVP; client FTS5 arrives with desktop |
| D11 | Export format: **NDJSON per stream per month** + content-addressed blobs + `manifest.json` |
| D12 | Plugins: server-side only, out-of-process, webhook-shaped, de-facto-standard incoming payloads |
| D13 | Stream access requires **current membership**; removal cuts all server-side history access; local copies are not retractable (documented property) |
| D14 | Ordering and display timestamps derive from **server sequence / server time only**; `client_created_at` is untrusted metadata |

Two deployed containers: `app` and `postgres`. Blobs live on a bind-mounted volume. **One uvicorn worker** — WebSocket fanout is an in-process registry; this constraint is documented in the compose file and revisited only when a real workspace outgrows it.

```

The `core/` event library is written once in Python and consumed by both server and CLI. The web client re-implements only the envelope construction + hashing (small, spec-tested against shared JSON test vectors in `core/testdata/` — both implementations must pass the same vectors).

## 2. Event model

### 2.1 Envelope: client body vs. server metadata

An event as stored and transmitted has two sections. **`event_hash` = SHA-256 over the RFC 8785 (JCS) canonicalization of the `body` object only.** The server never mutates `body`; everything the server knows goes in `server`.

```json
{
  "body": {
    "event_id": "01JZ7N6A4M6Y8W5K2H7DGKX4PA",
    "workspace_id": "w_01JZ...",
    "stream_id": "s_01JZ...",
    "type": "message.created",
    "type_version": 1,
    "author_user_id": "u_01JZ...",
    "author_device_id": "d_01JZ...",
    "client_created_at": "2026-07-04T18:22:10.123Z",
    "payload": {
      "message_id": "m_01JZ...",
      "text": "Hello everyone",
      "format": "markdown",
      "thread_root_id": null,
      "file_ids": [],
      "mentions": ["u_01JZ..."]
    }
  },
  "event_hash": "sha256:9f2c...",
  "signature": null,
  "server": {
    "server_sequence": 9284,
    "server_received_at": "2026-07-04T18:22:10.456Z",
    "payload_redacted": false
  }
}
```

Rules:

- `event_id` is a **ULID** minted by the client (sortable, offline-safe). All entity IDs (`u_`, `s_`, `m_`, `f_`, `d_`, `w_` + ULID) are client- or server-minted ULIDs with type prefixes.
- `signature` is **reserved, always null in MVP**. When device keys arrive (federation era), it signs `event_hash`. No `prev_event_hash` anywhere (assessment §3.4).
- `server.payload_redacted` is **reserved for post-MVP redaction**: the server may null `body.payload` and set this true; redacted events are exempt from hash verification. The field ships now so exports and clients handle it from day one. At M0 there is no redaction authority, so `msgctl verify` treats any event with `payload_redacted` set as a **failure**: the flag is client-writable in-band and cannot be allowed to waive its own hash check. The exemption described above is the **target** semantics — it re-activates at M1 only for authenticated, audited server redactions validated against their audit record, never the bare flag. (ENG-60 security ruling.)
- **`client_created_at` is untrusted** (D14). It may be displayed as "composed at" detail; all ordering, display timestamps, and "new since" logic use `server_sequence` and `server_received_at`.
- Max serialized event size: **64 KB** (hard reject at upload). The limit is measured over the §3.2 upload wire form — the UTF-8 bytes of `{ "body": …, "event_hash": … }` serialized compactly — **not** the full stored envelope; `signature` and `server` metadata are excluded, so the measured size is stable for a given `body` regardless of any server-attached metadata. (ENG-54 review clarification.)
- **JCS canonicalization depth cap (D1):** container nesting inside `body` is capped at **128 levels** (`MAX_DEPTH`); deeper input is rejected before hashing. The cap is a fixed protocol constant, not an implementation artifact, so the accept/reject boundary is identical across server processes and across the Python and TypeScript implementations. (ENG-55 security round.)
- **Integer interop cap (D1):** every integer appearing in a canonicalized `body` must lie within ±(2^53 − 1); values outside this range are rejected before hashing. This is inherent to RFC 8785's ECMAScript number model and is restated here because it is a hard wire-format constraint the TypeScript client must enforce on **magnitude** — its `JSON.parse` silently truncates values beyond 2^53 rather than raising. In practice a real `body` cannot reach the cap: all IDs are ULID strings and `type_version` is small, while sequences/counts live in `server` metadata, which is never canonicalized. (ENG-55 ruling.)

### 2.2 MVP event types

All flow through the same envelope; `payload` schemas are Pydantic models in `core/` (mirrored as JSON Schema in `docs/schemas/` for the web client and plugin authors).

**Channel/DM streams:**

| Type | Payload (required fields) | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `message.created` | `message_id`, `text`, `format`, `thread_root_id?`, `file_ids?`, `mentions?` | First reply to a root message *is* thread creation; no `thread.created` type |
| `message.edited` | `message_id`, `text`, `mentions?` | LWW by server order; history retained |
| `message.deleted` | `message_id` | Tombstone; projection hides |
| `reaction.added` | `message_id`, `emoji` | Idempotent on `(message_id, author_user_id, emoji)` |
| `reaction.removed` | `message_id`, `emoji` | Idempotent remove |
| `pin.added` / `pin.removed` | `message_id` | |
| `file.uploaded` | `file_id`, `sha256`, `name`, `mime_type`, `size_bytes` | Emitted after blob upload confirmed (§6) |

> **`message.created.format` domain (locked at `type_version` 1):** `format` is exactly `"markdown"` or `"plain"`. New format values arrive via a `type_version` bump (§2.3), **not** an additive enum widening — an older reader must never receive a `format` it cannot render. (ENG-54 ruling.) **`message.edited.format` shares this exact locked domain** (ENG-96).

> **`reaction.*.emoji` domain (locked at `type_version` 1):** `emoji` is a bounded **Unicode string** — non-empty and at most **64 bytes** when UTF-8 encoded — validated in the payload model. There is deliberately **no server-side emoji whitelist**: any non-empty ≤64-byte Unicode grapheme (base emoji, ZWJ sequence, skin-tone modifier, keycap, or even a short non-emoji string) is accepted; the byte bound is the only gate. Widening or narrowing this domain later (adding a whitelist, changing the byte cap) is a breaking change under D9 and must arrive via a `type_version` bump, exactly like `format`. The idempotency key `(message_id, author_user_id, emoji)` (§2.4) is enforced at projection time (ENG-97), not in the payload model. (ENG-96 ruling.)

**`workspace-meta` stream** (one per workspace; every **non-guest** member is subscribed):

| Type | Payload | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `workspace.created` | `name` | First event, sequence 1 |
| `user.joined` / `user.left` | `user_id`, `display_name?` | Workspace membership |
| `user.profile_updated` | `user_id`, changed fields | |
| `channel.created` | `channel_stream_id`, `name`, `visibility` (`public`/`private`) | |
| `channel.renamed` / `channel.archived` | `channel_stream_id`, … | |
| `channel.member_added` / `channel.member_removed` | `channel_stream_id`, `user_id` | Only these events grant/revoke private-channel access |
| `dm.created` | `dm_stream_id`, `member_user_ids` | DM/group-DM streams are created lazily on first message |
| `bot.installed` / `bot.removed` | `bot_user_id`, `name`, `scopes` | Plugin-era (M5) |

> **Guest exclusion (ENG-65 / §3.6):** "every member" here means every **non-guest** member (owner/admin/member). A `guest` is a member with restricted scope — §3.6: a guest sees only streams they are explicitly added to — so granting guests `workspace-meta` would leak the full public-channel and member roster. Guests read `workspace-meta` only via an explicit `stream_members` row, which they are never given for meta. The read predicate enforces this directly as `kind == 'workspace-meta' AND role != 'guest'`. (Consequence for the M2 member-list projection: guests do not receive meta.)

Membership events for **private** channels are visible in `workspace-meta` only to members of that channel? **No — simpler MVP rule:** private channel lifecycle events go into the **private channel's own stream**, not `workspace-meta`; `workspace-meta` carries only public-channel and workspace-level events. This keeps `workspace-meta` universally readable with zero filtering. (Consequence: a user's list of private channels is learned from `GET /v1/sync`, which only returns streams they can read.)

### 2.3 Schema evolution contract (D9)

1. `type_version` is **per event type**, starting at 1.
2. Within a version, changes are **additive-only**; all readers ignore unknown fields.
3. Unknown event *types* (or versions above a reader's max): **preserve in log/cache, skip in projection, never crash.** This is what lets old clients coexist with new servers.
4. Breaking change ⇒ increment `type_version`; the server may up-convert old versions at read time; clients send `max_supported_versions` at WebSocket connect (map of type → version) — the server uses it only for telemetry in MVP.
5. Every projection (server and client) declares a `PROJECTION_VERSION`. Bumping it forces a rebuild from the log/cache. **`rebuild` is a first-class, tested operation from M0 onward** — it is the escape hatch for every projection bug.

### 2.4 Conflict semantics (unchanged from design doc §12)

- Message creation: no conflict.
- Reactions: idempotent set ops keyed `(message_id, user_id, emoji)`.
- Edits: last write wins by `server_sequence`; prior payloads remain in the log (edit history UI reads them).
- Deletes: tombstones.
- Concurrent offline edits: server order decides; no merge UI in MVP.

---

## 3. Streams, sequencing, and the sync protocol

### 3.1 Streams and sequences (D2)

- A **stream** is the unit of ordering, permissioning, and sync: one per channel, one per DM/group-DM, one `workspace-meta` per workspace.
- The server assigns a **gapless, monotonically increasing `server_sequence` per stream** at accept time (Postgres: `UPDATE streams SET head_seq = head_seq + 1 ... RETURNING head_seq` inside the insert transaction — trivially correct under concurrency at this scale).
- **Client guarantee: per-stream sequences visible to an authorized member have no gaps.** A gap means data loss, not permissions — this is the integrity property per-workspace sequencing would have destroyed.

### 3.2 HTTP API

All endpoints under `/v1`, authenticated by `Authorization: Bearer <session_token>` (§7). Errors are RFC 9457 problem+json.

**`POST /v1/events/batch`** — upload client events.

```jsonc
// request
{ "events": [ { "body": {...}, "event_hash": "sha256:..." } ] }   // ≤ 100 events, ≤ 1 MB total
// response 200
{
  "accepted": [ { "event_id": "01JZ...", "stream_id": "s_...", "server_sequence": 9284, "server_received_at": "..." } ],
  "rejected": [ { "event_id": "01JZ...", "code": "permission_denied" | "invalid_schema" | "hash_mismatch" | "payload_too_large" | "unknown_stream", "detail": "..." } ]
}
```

- **Idempotency:** `event_id` is unique per workspace (Postgres unique index). A re-upload of an already-accepted event returns the *original* accepted record (same sequence), not an error and not a duplicate. This makes the client outbox a dumb retry loop.
- Validation order: session → workspace membership → stream write permission → schema (type + version) → `event_hash` recomputation (JCS) → payload referential checks (e.g., `file_ids` exist and were uploaded by this user; `message_id` exists for reactions/edits — or the event is rejected, no "pending reference" support in MVP) → size caps.
- Author fields (`author_user_id`, `author_device_id`) must match the session; mismatch ⇒ reject. Bot tokens (M5) may author only as their bot user.
- **Storability gate (envelope scalars, ENG-66):** the lax `Body` shape gate (`extra="allow"`) and a verifying `event_hash` are necessary but not sufficient — the envelope's scalar fields must also be **storable as typed** or the event is rejected `invalid_schema`. `type_version` must be a JSON **integer** within Postgres `INT4` range, and `client_created_at` must be a parseable RFC 3339 timestamp. An honestly-hashed but non-conforming form (e.g. a string `"1"` for `type_version`, hashed faithfully) is rejected **after** the hash check: the hash proves the bytes are the client's, not that they are storable. A JSONB-fatal body (e.g. a ` ` NUL inside a string — JSON-valid and JCS-hashable but rejected by Postgres JSONB) is likewise a per-event `invalid_schema`, isolated from the rest of the batch. This makes acceptance **total**: an event the server reports `accepted` is guaranteed round-trippable from storage. This narrows the §2.1 scalar domain (`type_version`, `client_created_at`) at the accept boundary. (ENG-66 deviation-1; supersedes that plan's "stored verbatim" companion ruling.)

**`GET /v1/sync`** — reconnect bootstrap.

```jsonc
// response: every stream the caller can currently read
{
  "streams": [
    { "stream_id": "s_meta...", "kind": "workspace-meta", "head_seq": 4102 },
    { "stream_id": "s_gen...",  "kind": "channel", "name": "general", "visibility": "public", "head_seq": 9284, "member": true },
    { "stream_id": "s_dm1...",  "kind": "dm", "member_user_ids": ["u_a","u_b"], "head_seq": 121 }
  ]
}
```

One round trip tells a reconnecting client exactly what to pull. Public channels the user hasn't joined appear (for the channel browser) with `member: false`.

**`GET /v1/events?stream_id=…&after=N&limit=500`** — forward catch-up (cursor pull).
**`GET /v1/events?stream_id=…&before=N&limit=500`** — **backward backfill** for cold start and scrollback: newest page first, lazily walk history. Both return `{ "events": [...], "has_more": bool }` in ascending sequence order within the page.

**Cold-start rule (assessment §3.14):** a new device does *not* replay full history. It pulls `GET /v1/sync`, then for each visible stream fetches the newest page (`before=head+1`), renders immediately, and backfills on scroll. `workspace-meta` alone is always synced from sequence 1 (it is small and the client needs full channel/member state).

**Other endpoints** (specified in their sections): `/v1/auth/*`, `/v1/read-state`, `/v1/prefs`, `/v1/files/*`, `/v1/search`, `/v1/admin/*`, `/v1/plugins/*`, `/v1/export`.

### 3.3 WebSocket

`GET /v1/ws` — one socket per client (per SharedWorker), authenticated via the **`Sec-WebSocket-Protocol: bearer, <token>`** subprotocol header, **not** a `?token=` query parameter: the raw session token must never appear in a URL, where it leaks into reverse-proxy access logs, browser history, and `Referer` headers that no in-process log filter can reach. The server echoes `Sec-WebSocket-Protocol: bearer` on accept (required for the browser handshake to complete). The M2 web client opens the socket as `new WebSocket(url, ["bearer", token])`; the session token is `secrets.token_urlsafe(32)`, whose alphabet (`[A-Za-z0-9-_]`, no `=` padding) is entirely valid subprotocol characters, so it rides the header unencoded. The delivery contract and frame set below are unchanged. (ENG-68 security ruling; supersedes the `?token=` form.) Messages are JSON frames:

**Server → client:**
- `{"t": "event", "event": {envelope}}` — a newly sequenced event on a stream the connection's user can read. Fanout is permission-scoped at send time: the hub resolves recipients from the in-memory membership map (invalidated by membership events).
- `{"t": "read_state", "stream_id": ..., "last_read_seq": ...}` — another device of the same user moved a read marker.
- `{"t": "presence", "user_id": ..., "state": "active"|"away"|"offline"}` — **excludes guests entirely** (ENG-125 follow-up): a guest neither broadcasts their own presence nor receives anyone else's. Presence is a workspace-**roster** signal (opaque `user_id` + online bit), so it is scoped out of guests exactly like the `workspace-meta` roster (§3.6).
- `{"t": "typing", "stream_id": ..., "user_id": ...}` — server relays, TTL 5 s, client-side expiry. Stream-membership-scoped (unchanged): a guest still gets/sends typing in streams they explicitly joined.

**Client → server:**
- `{"t": "typing", "stream_id": ...}` (rate-limited 1/3 s per stream)
- `{"t": "presence", "state": "active"|"away"}`
- `{"t": "ping"}` / server `{"t": "pong"}` — 30 s heartbeat; missed heartbeats close the socket.

**Delivery contract:** WebSocket push is an optimization, not the source of truth. The client treats frames as hints and trusts only cursors: on every (re)connect it runs `GET /v1/sync` + catch-up pulls; any pushed event with `server_sequence != cursor + 1` for its stream triggers a pull for that stream instead of blind application. This one rule eliminates the entire class of missed/duplicate-push bugs.

### 3.4 The three message classes (D3)

| Class | Examples | Store | Transport | In export? |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **Durable events** | messages, reactions, edits, membership | Postgres `events` (+ client caches) | batch upload / pull / WS push | **Yes** |
| **Synced per-user state** | read markers, notification prefs | Postgres KV tables | `PUT/GET /v1/read-state`, `/v1/prefs` + WS echo to own devices | No |
| **Ephemeral signals** | presence, typing | in-memory only | WebSocket frames | No |

Anything new must be assigned to a class before it is built. "Is this an event?" is answered by: *would it belong in a 30-year archive of the workspace?*

### 3.5 Read state and unread counts (assessment §3.5)

```
PUT /v1/read-state          { "stream_id": "s_...", "last_read_seq": 9280 }
GET /v1/read-state          → [ { "stream_id": ..., "last_read_seq": ..., "updated_at": ... } ]
```

- Server stores `(user_id, stream_id) → last_read_seq` (monotonic: a PUT with a lower seq is ignored).
- Unread badge = `head_seq − last_read_seq` (client computes from its projection; server computes for the sidebar bootstrap payload).
- Mention badges: client projection indexes `payload.mentions` at apply time; a mention with `seq > last_read_seq` sets the red badge. No server round trip.
- Notification preferences (per-stream: `all` / `mentions` / `mute`) use the same shape: `PUT/GET /v1/prefs`.

### 3.6 Permissions (D13)

Roles: `owner`, `admin`, `member`, `guest` (workspace) — `guest` sees only streams they're explicitly added to. Stream-level: membership set per private channel/DM; public channels are readable/writable by all non-guest members (join = subscribe, but reading a public channel doesn't require joining).

Enforcement points (each independently tested):
1. **Upload:** write permission on the target stream.
2. **Pull (`/v1/events`, `/v1/sync`):** current read permission; non-member of a private stream gets `404` (not `403` — existence is not disclosed).
3. **WebSocket fanout:** recipient set recomputed on membership events.
4. **Files (§6):** via `file_id` → stream → membership.
5. **Search:** filtered by readable streams in the query itself.

Removal from a private channel cuts server-side access to *all* of its history immediately (mainstream team-chat semantics). Already-synced local copies are not retractable — this is documented user-facing behavior, inherent to local-first.

## 4. Server design

### 4.1 Stack

Python 3.12, FastAPI, uvicorn (**one worker**), SQLAlchemy 2 async + asyncpg, Alembic migrations, Pydantic v2 for all payload schemas, `argon2-cffi`, `rfc8785` (or vendored ~100-line JCS implementation with test vectors). No Redis, no queue, no Celery — background work (webhook delivery, export jobs) uses `asyncio` tasks in-process.

### 4.2 Postgres schema (core tables)

Accept path for one event (single transaction): validate → `SELECT ... FOR UPDATE` on the stream row → `head_seq + 1` → insert into `events` → apply to `messages_proj` → commit → hand to WS hub for fanout. On `UNIQUE (workspace_id, event_id)` violation: fetch and return the original accepted record (idempotent path).

**Server-side projections follow the same rebuild contract as clients:** `msgctl rebuild-projections` truncates `messages_proj` and replays `events`. CI runs it and diffs against incremental state (M0 exit criterion, kept forever). The rebuild is a **single transaction** — one `TRUNCATE messages_proj` followed by an ordered replay of `events` through `apply_projection`, committed once (ENG-69) — so it is atomic and safe to interrupt: a killed rebuild rolls back to the prior projection, never a partial one. `TRUNCATE` takes an `ACCESS EXCLUSIVE` lock that briefly blocks concurrent reads of `messages_proj` for the rebuild's duration, which is acceptable for a single-operator admin op at M1 scale; `DELETE FROM messages_proj` (ROW-EXCLUSIVE, MVCC-invisible to other snapshots until commit) is the documented drop-in should read-during-rebuild concurrency ever matter.

### 4.3 Operational guardrails

| Guardrail | Value (config-overridable) |
|---|---|
| Max event size | 64 KB |
| Max batch | 100 events / 1 MB |
| Rate limit: events per user | 60/min sustained, burst 20/s |
| Rate limit: auth attempts | 10/min per IP + per email |
| Max file size | 100 MB |
| Per-workspace file quota | 10 GiB default |
| WS connections per user | 10 |
| Pull page size | ≤ 500 events |

**Backups:** everything lives in two places — the Postgres volume and the blob directory. Documented story: `pg_dump` + rsync of `blobs/`, or snapshot the single data directory; *and* `msgctl export` produces the portable NDJSON workspace folder, which is itself a full logical backup. Restore = import.

**Observability:** structured JSON logs (uvicorn + app), `/healthz` (DB ping), `/metrics` (Prometheus text: event throughput, WS connection count, fanout latency). OpenTelemetry deferred.

## 5. Web client design

### 5.1 Architecture (D4)

Vue 3 + TypeScript + Pinia + Tailwind + TipTap (composer). Vite build, served by the FastAPI app (single origin — no CORS, cookies stay simple).

**SharedWorker owns all shared mutable state** (assessment §3.14): the WebSocket, the Dexie (IndexedDB) database, the sync engine, and the outbox. Tabs are dumb views: they talk to the worker over `postMessage` RPC (query projections, subscribe to stream updates, enqueue sends). Fallback for browsers without SharedWorker (Safari < 16): Web Locks leader election, same interface. This is built in M2, not retrofitted.

### 5.2 Dexie schema

```ts
// db.ts — PROJECTION_VERSION guards all derived tables
events:      "[stream_id+server_sequence], event_id, type"   // raw envelopes (cache, evictable)
messages:    "message_id, stream_id, [stream_id+created_seq], thread_root_id"
streams:     "stream_id, kind"                               // + name, visibility, head_seq, member
cursors:     "stream_id"                                     // last_contiguous_seq, oldest_loaded_seq
outbox:      "event_id, created_at"                          // body + state: queued|sending|rejected
read_state:  "stream_id"                                     // last_read_seq (local echo of server KV)
meta:        "key"                                           // projection_version, session info, my user_id
```

- The cache is **bounded**: per stream keep the newest ~2,000 events; older pages are re-fetched via `before=` on scroll. Eviction never touches `outbox`.
- `PROJECTION_VERSION` mismatch on boot ⇒ drop derived tables, re-apply from cached `events`, then resume pulls (the client-side `rebuild`).
- IndexedDB absence/failure (private browsing) degrades gracefully: in-memory cache, everything still works online.

### 5.3 Sync engine (in the worker)

State machine per connection: `connecting → syncing → live → degraded(offline)`.

1. On connect: `GET /v1/sync` → diff heads against local cursors → parallel catch-up pulls (`after=`) for behind streams; new streams get newest-page pulls (`before=`).
2. `live`: apply WS `event` frames; **any sequence discontinuity ⇒ targeted pull** (§3.3 delivery contract).
3. Outbox drain loop: oldest-first, `POST /v1/events/batch`, exponential backoff (1 s → 30 s cap, jitter); on `accepted` → move event from outbox into `events`/projection with its real sequence; on `rejected` → mark the message failed in-UI (retry/delete affordance). Drain runs whenever connectivity resumes — a message composed during a Wi-Fi blip sends itself.
4. **Send path is optimistic:** composer → build envelope + hash in worker → insert into projection as `pending` (renders instantly, greyed timestamp) → enqueue outbox. On ack, the message settles into server order; because pending messages render at the bottom and acks arrive in seconds, reordering jank is minimal by construction.

### 5.4 UX surfaces (M2–M3)

- **Sidebar:** channels (unread bold, mention badge), DMs, presence dots; instant channel switching (projection reads, no network).
- **Message list:** virtualized scroll, day dividers, backward pagination on scroll-top, edit/delete affordances, reactions with picker, hover toolbar.
- **Composer (TipTap):** markdown shortcuts, `@mention` autocomplete (fed from workspace-meta projection), file drag-drop/paste, Enter-to-send / Shift-Enter newline, edit-last-message on ArrowUp.
- **Threads:** right-hand panel (flat-channel model); root messages show reply count/participants from projection.
- **Notifications:** in-app badges + tab-title count + `Notification` API (permission-gated) for mentions/DMs while the app is open, respecting per-stream prefs. Web Push = M3 stretch, not blocking.
- **Search:** search box → `GET /v1/search?q=…&in=…&from=…` (server FTS), results panel with jump-to-context (jump = targeted `before/after` pulls around the hit).
- **Keyboard:** Cmd+K switcher (fuzzy channel/DM/user), Alt+↑/↓ unread channel nav, Esc marks read. The switcher ships in M2 — it is cheap and defines the "fast" feel.

## 6. Attachments (D8)

Upload (server-proxied in MVP — no presigned URLs until S3 backend exists):

```
1. client: sha256(file) locally
2. POST /v1/files/initiate { sha256, name, mime_type, size_bytes, stream_id }
     → { file_id, upload_needed: bool }        // authz: write access to stream_id; quota + size checked here
3. if upload_needed: PUT /v1/files/{file_id}/blob   (streaming body; server verifies sha256 while writing)
4. client emits file.uploaded event, then message.created with file_ids
```

- Blob store: local disk `blobs/sha256/ab/abcd1234…`, behind a `BlobStore` interface (`put/get/exists/delete`) so S3/MinIO is a config change later.
- **Download authz by `file_id` only** (`GET /v1/files/{file_id}` → membership check on its stream → stream response). Raw hashes are never a URL. Dedup (`upload_needed: false`) is only revealed *after* the caller passed authz and quota checks for creating a file record.
- Orphaned blobs: `files.stream_id` is **set at `initiate`** (under a write-access gate) and is the **authoritative download-authz key** — it is never null for a live row and never marks an orphan (superseding the pre-ENG-116 "null `stream_id` marks orphans" framing). A future GC keys on *refcount* instead: an orphan is a **present `files` row never referenced by any accepted `message.created.file_ids`** (not a null `stream_id`). Post-MVP GC design (written now, built later): refcount = live `files` rows per sha256 referenced by an accepted message; sweep unreferenced blobs older than 30 days via `msgctl gc`.
- Image files get server-generated thumbnails (Pillow, max 720 px, stored as derived blobs) — M3, needed for a polished message list.

---

## 7. Auth, identity, invites (D6)

- **Registration:** first user on a fresh server creates the workspace and becomes `owner` (guided by `msgctl init` or first-run web flow). Everyone else joins via invite link.
- **Invites:** `POST /v1/admin/invites { role, ttl }` → single-use URL `https://host/join/<token>` (token random 256-bit, stored hashed). Acceptance page collects email + display name + password → creates user, marks invite used, emits `user.joined` to `workspace-meta`. SMTP is **optional** (config for "email this link"); the link itself is the mechanism.
- **Login:** `POST /v1/auth/login { email, password, device_label }` → argon2id verify → mint `device_id` (per browser install, persisted in IndexedDB `meta`; reused on re-login) → mint opaque session token (random 256-bit; stored **hashed**; returned once) → client stores it in worker-held memory + IndexedDB. Rolling 90-day expiry, `last_seen_at` updated on use.
- **Revocation:** sessions list + revoke in user settings (`DELETE /v1/auth/sessions/{id}`); instant, because every request hits the sessions table (indexed PK lookup — no measurable cost at this scale). This is why **no JWT**.
- Password reset: admin-issued reset link in MVP (same machinery as invites). Self-serve email reset arrives with optional SMTP.
- `devices.public_key` reserved null — device signing keys are federation-era.

---

## 8. Search (D10)

`GET /v1/search?q=…&in=<stream_id>&from=<user_id>&before=<date>&after=<date>&limit=25&cursor=…`

- Postgres FTS over `messages_proj.search_tsv`, joined against the caller's readable-streams set (same predicate as `/v1/events` authz — one shared SQL fragment, tested once).
- `websearch_to_tsquery` for Google-ish syntax; rank by `ts_rank_cd`, tie-break recency. Deleted/redacted messages excluded.
- Filter grammar parsed client-side into query params (`from:@dana in:#general before:2026-07-01`).
- Known MVP limits (documented, accepted): English stemming config, no attachment content indexing, no fuzzy match. Desktop FTS5 and/or server upgrade path (pg_trgm, Meilisearch) post-MVP.

---

## 9. Export / import (D11)

**Export** (`msgctl export <dir>` or `GET /v1/export` as tar stream, admin-only):

```text
workspace-export/
  manifest.json          # format_version, workspace meta, stream index (id→kind/name/head_seq),
                         # blob index (sha256 → size, referencing file_ids), event counts, export time
  streams/
    <stream_id>/
      2026-07.ndjson     # full envelopes (body + server metadata), ascending server_sequence
  blobs/
    sha256/ab/abcd1234...
  users.json             # user/profile snapshot (no password hashes)
```

- One NDJSON line = one full envelope exactly as served by the API. Keyed by `stream_id`, never by name (rename-safe). Month split by `server_received_at`.
- **Verification:** `msgctl verify <dir>` recomputes every `event_hash` (JCS over `body`), checks per-stream sequence contiguity, and re-hashes every blob. This command is the ownership pitch made testable.
- **Import** (`msgctl import <dir>` into an empty server): replays envelopes preserving sequences, restores blobs, rebuilds projections. Round-trip test (`export → import → export` byte-identical modulo timestamps) is M4's exit criterion.
- Private streams and DMs are included — export is a server-admin operation and the export is the whole workspace. (Per-user export: post-MVP.)

---

## 10. Plugins (M5, D12)

- **Incoming webhooks:** `POST /v1/hooks/<hook_token>` accepting the de-facto standard incoming-webhook shape (`{"text": …, "blocks"?: …}` — text + a small supported subset), producing a `message.created` authored by the hook's bot user in its configured channel. This makes existing chat-webhook integrations work day one.
- **Outgoing subscriptions:** registration record `{plugin_id, name, url, secret, event_types[], stream_ids[]|all-public}`. Server POSTs matching envelopes (HMAC-SHA256 signature header, 5 s timeout, 3 retries with backoff, auto-disable after 100 consecutive failures + admin notification). At-least-once delivery; consumers dedupe by `event_id`.
- **Bot users:** `is_bot=true`, no password; auth via scoped tokens (`events:write:<stream>`, `events:read:<stream>`, `files:write`). Bot-authored events are flagged in UI by authorship (no envelope change needed).
- Explicitly not in MVP: in-process/WASM plugin runtime, slash-command framework (a bot can implement commands by reading messages), plugin marketplace.

## 11. Deployment

```yaml
# docker-compose.yml
services:
  app:
    image: msg/server            # multi-stage build: web dist baked into the Python image
    ports: ["8080:8080"]
    environment:
      MSG_DATABASE_URL: postgresql+asyncpg://msg:${POSTGRES_PASSWORD}@postgres/msg
      MSG_DATA_DIR: /data        # blobs live here
      MSG_SECRET_KEY: ${MSG_SECRET_KEY}
    volumes: [ "./data:/data" ]
    depends_on: [ postgres ]
    # NOTE: exactly one app container / one uvicorn worker.
    # WebSocket fanout is in-process; horizontal scaling requires a shared
    # pub/sub layer (deliberately out of scope for MVP).
  postgres:
    image: postgres:17
    environment: { POSTGRES_DB: msg, POSTGRES_USER: msg, POSTGRES_PASSWORD: ${POSTGRES_PASSWORD} }
    volumes: [ "./postgres:/var/lib/postgresql/data" ]
```

Two services, no MinIO, no Redis (assessment §4/§28). TLS via the operator's reverse proxy (Caddy/nginx/Traefik — documented recipe with Caddy, since it's two lines and auto-HTTPS). Alembic migrations run on app startup. `msgctl` ships inside the image (`docker compose exec app msgctl …`).

---

## 12. Testing strategy

**The M2 acceptance suite is the project's go/no-go gate.** Property-based simulation tests (`hypothesis` + `pytest`) drive N simulated clients against a real server instance (in-process ASGI + ephemeral Postgres via `testcontainers`), with randomized interleavings of: sends, edits, reactions, disconnects mid-request, retries, reconnects, membership changes. Invariants asserted after every run:

1. **Idempotency:** duplicate uploads never create duplicate events; retried mid-flight sends converge to exactly one accepted event.
2. **Convergence:** all clients' projections are byte-identical to each other and to a fresh rebuild-from-pull.
3. **Cursor integrity:** reconnect after arbitrary missed events yields gapless, duplicate-free per-stream sequences.
4. **Permission isolation:** a client without membership observes zero private-stream data via pull, sync heads, search, files, or WS fanout — asserted by a dedicated "adversary client" in every simulation run.
5. **Pending settling:** optimistic messages end in correct server order with no lost/duplicated renders (asserted at the projection layer; visual jank is a manual QA item).
6. **Rebuild equivalence:** dropping projections and replaying equals incremental state — client (Dexie) and server (`messages_proj`) both.

> **M1 ships a subset (ENG-71), M2 turns on all six.** The M1 exit gate ships the property-based harness asserting **four** of the six invariants on every example: idempotency (1), convergence (2 — the pull/log-equality half), cursor integrity (3), and permission isolation (4 — the adversary-client acceptance criterion, asserted every run and audited across the four live §3.6 enforcement points). **Pending settling (5)** and the projection-equivalence half of **rebuild equivalence (6)** are documented seams, not asserted at M1: invariant 5 needs the M2 web client's optimistic-render layer, and the projection-equivalence half is already held by the permanent M0/M1 `rebuild ≡ incremental` gates. The M1 skeleton's client-state model and invariant shapes are the M2 shapes, so **M2 extends this suite rather than rewriting it** — and M2's hard gate is exactly "all six green in CI."

Plus: unit tests for JCS/hashing against shared cross-language test vectors (`core/testdata/vectors.json` — Python and TS must both pass); schema round-trip tests per event type/version; API contract tests from the OpenAPI schema; Playwright smoke for the golden path (login → send → reload → history intact → second browser sees message live).

## 13. Milestones

Sized for ~1 engineer + AI tooling; each milestone has a hard exit criterion.

| # | Scope | Exit criterion |
|---|---|---|
| **M0 — Protocol spike** (1 wk) | `core/` envelope + JCS + hashing; `msgctl` appends `message.created` to NDJSON, projects to SQLite, `rebuild`, `verify` | Rebuild ≡ incremental, hash vectors frozen, envelope schema locked for TDD §2 |
| **M1 — Sync server** (3 wk) | Auth/sessions/invites, streams + membership, `workspace-meta`, batch upload w/ per-stream sequencing + idempotency, pull (`after`/`before`), `/v1/sync`, WS push w/ scoped fanout, Postgres schema + migrations, compose file | Two `msgctl`-driven clients converge over the real server; simulation suite skeleton green |
| **M2 — Web client + sync proof** (3 wk) | Vue shell: login, sidebar, message list, composer; SharedWorker + Dexie cache + cursors + outbox; reconnect catch-up; pending→acked settling; Cmd+K switcher | **All six §12 invariants green in CI.** Hard gate: no M3 work until they pass |
| **M3 — Messaging core** (5 wk) | Threads, reactions, edits/deletes, mentions + notifications (in-app/tab/Notification API), read-state + unread badges, presence/typing, file upload/download + thumbnails, server search, channel & member management UI | **Dogfood gate: builders use msg as their only team chat for 2 weeks** |
| **M4 — Portability** (1–2 wk) | `export` / `import` / `verify` (NDJSON + blobs + manifest) | Round-trip export→import→export identical; verify green on dogfood workspace |
| **M5 — Plugins** (2 wk) | Incoming de-facto-standard webhooks, outgoing subscriptions, bot tokens; GitHub notifier as reference plugin | GitHub PR events posting into dogfood workspace via the public plugin API only |
| **M6 — Desktop (Tauri)** | Same Vue app in Tauri; real SQLite + FTS5 projection, NDJSON logs on disk, true offline, local search | "Workspace is a folder" demo: kill network, full app works; folder passes `msgctl verify` |

Cut entirely: federation experiment (design doc M6). The envelope reserves what federation needs (`signature`, origin fields, content hashes); building it earns nothing before the product has users.

**Post-MVP backlog (designed-not-built, in priority order):** Web Push notifications · blob GC (`msgctl gc`) · redaction mechanism (`payload_redacted`) · proprietary-chat import · per-user export · self-serve password reset via SMTP · S3 blob backend · mobile.

---

## 14. Risks

| Risk | Mitigation |
|---|---|
| UX worse than incumbent chat apps despite sound architecture (design doc §25.1 — the #1 risk) | M3 dogfood gate is mandatory; composer/switcher/unread polish are milestone line items, not "later"; virtualized list + optimistic sends from day one |
| Sync bugs erode trust (lost/duplicated/reordered messages) | §12 simulation suite as CI gate before features; delivery contract (§3.3) makes push safe-by-construction; idempotent outbox |
| Single-process fanout ceiling | Documented constraint; at 5–50 users the ceiling is far away; the protocol is process-count-agnostic, so a pub/sub layer or Go sync-path port slots in without protocol changes |
| Scope creep toward federation/E2EE/offline-web | This TDD's cut lines (D-table, §13 cuts) are the contract; changes require revising this doc, not drive-by PRs |
| Export format becomes stale vestige | `verify` in CI against dogfood data from M4 onward; export is the backup story, so it stays load-bearing |
| Solo-builder bus factor / stall in the 5-week M3 | M3 is decomposed into independently shippable features gated on M2's frozen protocol; each lands behind the dogfood instance |

---

## 15. Deviations from the design doc (for the record)

All adopted from the tech-lead assessment: per-stream sequencing replaces per-workspace (§11.4 reversed) · `prev_event_hash` dropped, `signature` reserved · envelope split into hashed body + server metadata · web MVP is online-first (no browser NDJSON/SQLite-WASM); full offline moves to desktop M6 · server-side search replaces client FTS5 for MVP · MinIO cut from compose · `thread.created` event removed · unread/presence/typing designed as non-event classes · milestone order reworked (server before web UI; portability before plugins; federation cut). Everything else implements the design doc as written.

- **M0 exit-gate amendments (ENG-62, additive):** §2.1 now states the JCS depth cap (128 levels) and the integer interop cap (±(2^53 − 1)) as explicit D1 protocol constants, clarifies that the 64 KB cap is measured over the §3.2 `{ body, event_hash }` wire form, §2.2 locks `message.created.format` to `"markdown"|"plain"` at `type_version` 1, and §2.1 records that M0 `verify` fails on a set `payload_redacted` flag until authenticated redaction ships at M1. These are clarifications of already-implemented behavior, not decision changes; no envelope field was added, removed, or renamed.
- **Presence excludes guests entirely (ENG-125 follow-up, §3.6 roster-consistency):** presence is a workspace-**roster** signal (an opaque `user_id` + online bit for members across the workspace), so a guest neither **broadcasts** their own presence (the router skips the online/offline relay for a guest subject) nor **receives** anyone else's (`hub.publish_presence` never selects a guest recipient). This is the same guest scope `readable_streams_predicate` already enforces for the `workspace-meta` roster (the FLAGGED DEVIATION — a guest is a member with restricted scope and does not receive the member/public-channel roster). **Typing is unchanged:** it stays stream-membership-scoped via the same `readable_streams_predicate`, so a guest still gets/sends typing in streams they have explicitly joined. Two-layer exclusion (no-broadcast in the router + non-guest recipient filter in the hub) so the property is robust regardless of which side connects first.
- **M1 exit-gate amendments (ENG-73, additive):** §3.3 records that the WebSocket authenticates via `Sec-WebSocket-Protocol: bearer, <token>` (raw token off the URL — no log/proxy/history leak; server echoes `bearer` on accept), superseding the `?token=` form; §3.2 adds the storability gate (envelope scalars — integer `type_version` within `INT4`, parseable RFC 3339 `client_created_at`, JSONB-safe strings — are rejected `invalid_schema` at accept even when the lax `Body` gate and the hash both pass, so "accepted" implies round-trippable storage); §2.2 clarifies that "every member" subscribed to `workspace-meta` means every **non-guest** member (§3.6 guest scope); §4.2 states the Postgres rebuild is a single-transaction `TRUNCATE messages_proj` + ordered replay, safe to interrupt; and §12 notes the M1 simulation suite asserts four of the six invariants (pending-settling and the projection half of rebuild-equivalence are M2). These are clarifications and within-milestone surface corrections of already-implemented behavior — no envelope field and no locked D-decision changed.

- **M2 exit-gate amendments (ENG-84, additive):** the web-client milestone. No envelope field and no locked D-decision changed; the following record the M2 build's realized decisions and within-milestone deviations, each tracked by its ticket.
  1. **Acceptance-suite cross-language architecture ("extend, don't rewrite").** The six §12 invariants are asserted in the language each property lives in, not re-implemented once. The Python hypothesis simulation owns invariants 1–4 + server-6 (`messages_proj` rebuild ≡ incremental); a TypeScript [`fast-check`](https://github.com/dubzzz/fast-check) property suite owns invariant 5 (pending→acked settling) + client-6 (Dexie rebuild-equivalence), driving the **real** worker engine (outbox/projection/db), not a mock; a Playwright golden path covers the live E2E. "All six green in CI" is the conjunction of the `lint · type · test`, `web · … · build`, and `e2e · golden path` jobs (ENG-83).
  2. **The M2 composer is a plain `<textarea>`.** The TipTap rich composer (mentions / markdown / paste-handling) was deferred to M3; the `Composer` component seam is kept so the richer editor drops in without shell churn (ENG-82). **Delivered in M3 (ENG-101):** the `<textarea>` internals are replaced by TipTap (StarterKit + two Mention instances) at the SAME component seam — the send/format wire contract is unchanged (messages still go out as markdown SOURCE text via `outbox.send`, never HTML). Markdown input shortcuts render rich and serialize back to source; `@`/`#` autocomplete is fed by a new zero-network `directory.list` projection query (users folded from the cached `workspace-meta` events, channels from `streams`), and resolved `u_` mention ids populate the payload `mentions[]`/`mention_user_ids`. XSS boundary: pasted HTML is stripped to inert text before ProseMirror parses it (no `v-html` anywhere). Two clean seams are left: ArrowUp-on-empty emits `edit-last` for the ENG-102 edit round-trip, and dropped/pasted files emit `files` for the M3.5 upload flow.
  3. **`EventRow.envelope` is an OPTIONAL `StoredEnvelope`**, reconciled across the sync engine (ENG-79) and client projections (ENG-80) — fixtures build body-only rows, so the field cannot be assumed present. Hash-verify is **fail-closed**: a row whose `event_hash` is missing or does not match its recomputed hash is skipped, never stored, and the per-stream cursor never advances past it (a corrupt/forged event cannot poison the projection or strand the cursor).
  4. **WS bearer-subprotocol auth under the default backend (ENG-92).** uvicorn's default sans-io `websockets` backend delivers `Sec-WebSocket-Protocol: bearer, <token>` to ASGI as **one un-split element** `["bearer, <token>"]`, whereas the dev `wsproto` path splits it into two. `_bearer_token` now normalizes **both** shapes, so the shipped default backend (the only one `uvicorn[standard]` ships in the image) authenticates the subprotocol with no `--ws` override. Class-of-bug lesson: in-process ASGI WS tests do not surface the un-split shape — a **real-subprocess-uvicorn** regression test was added to catch it.
  5. **Display timestamps are decoded from the ULID `message_id` mint epoch** (client time at send), used for message and day-divider rendering, because the byte-asserted projection dump carries no server-time column. Carrying server-assigned time through to the display layer is deferred (ENG-90).
  6. **Virtualization is fixed-height windowing for M2.** Dynamic per-row height measurement (variable-height messages) is deferred (ENG-88); the virtualized list seam is kept.
  7. **Optimistic send settles under the client's HASH-BOUND `stream_id`** and **rejects a server `stream_id` that does not match** the one the client derived (security hardening — the server cannot silently re-home a pending send onto a different stream). The SharedWorker owns the session token; a `no-http-in-ui` guard walks `components/`, `stores/`, `composables/`, and `views/` recursively to enforce that the token and raw HTTP client never reach a tab-side module (ENG-78, ENG-81).
  8. **The Docker image now bakes `web/dist`** (this ticket). A multi-stage Node 22 + pnpm 9.15.0 web-builder compiles the SPA and copies only the built dist to `/app/web/dist`; `create_app()` mounts it at `/`, so `docker compose up --build` serves the client **single-origin** alongside `/v1`. The Node toolchain stays out of the runtime image.

- **`/v1/setup` seeds a default `#general` channel (ENG-109, additive):** first-run setup now emits a THIRD meta event after `workspace.created`(1) + owner `user.joined`(2) — a server-authored PUBLIC `channel.created`(3) for a channel named by the `default_channel_name` setting (`"general"`), homed in `workspace-meta` (§2.2 public placement). The same reducer-before-insert ordering (D4) has `_reduce_channel_created` create the channel's own stream row (`head_seq` 0) + the owner's `stream_members` row in the setup transaction, so the owner's `GET /v1/sync` returns `general` (public, `member:true`) immediately — a fresh workspace is usable out of the box, without the (not-yet-built) web channel-creation UI. `msgctl login` now `pull`s right after binding so the client learns the server's `general` by name and reuses it on `send --stream general` (no duplicate `channel.created`). `channel.created` is an existing event type and no envelope field or locked D-decision changed — purely additive.

- **M3 messaging-core amendments (ENG-105, additive):** the messaging-core milestone. **No envelope field and no locked D-decision changed**; the following record the M3 build's realized decisions and within-milestone deviations, each tracked by its ticket. All M3 event types are pre-existing (`reaction.added/removed`, `message.edited/deleted`, `channel.*`, `dm.created`); M3 built the projections + UI over them.
  1. **Reactions — a bounded OPAQUE-BYTES emoji domain + client seq-aware LWW (ENG-96/97/100).** A reaction `emoji` is opaque bytes (≤64, NUL excluded — Postgres text/JSONB rejects it pre-projection), NOT a validated grapheme: a base emoji and its skin-tone/ZWJ variants are DISTINCT byte sequences that must not collide under the C-collation uniqueness key `(message_id, author_user_id, emoji)`. `reaction.added` is a set-add and `reaction.removed` a set-discard — both idempotent (duplicate add / absent remove are no-ops), so a byte-noisy log folds to an exact membership set (`reactions_proj`, server side). The client mirror is **seq-aware LWW**: an out-of-order `removed@lo` after an `added@hi` must NOT resurrect a removed reaction — the projection keeps a per-`(message,user,emoji)` tombstone stamped with `server_sequence` so the highest-seq event wins regardless of delivery order.
  2. **`message.edited` — last-writer-wins by `server_sequence` (ENG-98/100).** Server `messages_proj` and the client projection both overwrite `text` + `edited_seq` ONLY when the edit's `server_sequence` exceeds the row's current `edited_seq or created_seq`, so concurrent/out-of-order edits converge to the highest-seq winner. The author-or-admin rule is server-enforced (a non-author edit is refused, not merely stream-gated). The client carries text AND `format` through the edit. An `(edited)` marker renders whenever `edited_seq` is set.
  3. **`message.deleted` — a SOFT-DELETE tombstone with content redaction; true erasure deferred (ENG-98/100/111).** Delete is terminal (a later edit never un-deletes) and sets `deleted=true` + redacts `text` to `''` in the projection, so a deleted message serves NO content through the read model. The UI renders a muted tombstone and the confirm is worded honestly ("removed for everyone"), **never** as cryptographic erasure — the append-only log still retains the original event. **True redaction** (a `payload_redacted` erasure mechanism that rewrites the stored log) is a deliberate follow-up, **ENG-111**.
  4. **Threads — flat, no new event type; reply_count = non-deleted recompute + `thread_participants_proj` (ENG-99/100/103, D7).** A reply is an ordinary `message.created` carrying `thread_root_id` = its (non-reply) root; a reply-of-reply is server-rejected (threads stay one level deep). A root's `reply_count` is the count of its NON-deleted replies and `last_reply_seq` their max `server_sequence` — both **delete-aware recomputes** (deleting a reply decrements the count and drops the ghost participant), not monotonic counters. `thread_participants_proj` is the distinct set of non-deleted reply authors per root. The client recomputes a root's counters from its cached replies, so an out-of-order **reply-before-root** delivery still converges once the root arrives (recompute-self on apply).
  5. **`dm.created` — self-homed, participant-based isolation (ENG-104).** A DM is a stream whose membership is its participant set; a non-participant sees it in neither sync nor a direct read (404) and cannot write into it (refused at the stream gate). The simulation's adversary probes all three every run. 1:1 for M3 (group DM deferred).
  6. **The composer is TipTap (ENG-101), replacing the M2 `<textarea>` at the same seam** — recorded in the ENG-84/M2 block (item 2). The wire contract is unchanged: messages go out as markdown SOURCE text via `outbox.send`, never HTML; `@`/`#` autocomplete reads the zero-network `directory.list` projection; pasted HTML is stripped to inert text (no `v-html`).
  7. **The OUT-OF-ORDER client-projection lesson + the windowed invariant-6 gate (ENG-100/105).** M3's cross-message references (a reaction/edit/delete/reply that names a message the client may not have applied yet) made delivery ORDER a correctness surface the M2 append-only message projection never had. The client therefore reconciles against its `events` cache on apply (recompute-self for thread counters, seq-aware LWW for reactions/edits, replay-cached-mutations for edit-before-create). The §12 invariant-6 client gate was hardened to prove it: it now replays each generated history under **windowed newest-first-then-backfill** delivery (the real cold-start + scroll-up ordering) and asserts `rebuild ≡ incremental` byte-equal, with deterministic TEETH for reply-before-root, reaction `removed@lo`+`added@hi`, and edit-before-create.
  8. **Invite/setup auto-join `#general` (ENG-109/112).** Setup auto-adds only the OWNER (via `channel.created`'s genesis member-add, ENG-109); a later invitee is auto-joined to the default `#general` on accept via a server-authored `channel.member_added` self-join (ENG-112, §2.2 homes the public-channel lifecycle event in `workspace-meta`). Guests are excluded (their scope is explicit-membership streams only). So every full member lands in a non-empty sidebar out of the box. A browser self-join of a *public* channel from the channel browser is a local view-open (reading a public channel needs no membership event, §3.6); a **persistent** public self-join membership is deferred (**ENG-113**).
  9. **Cross-language vectors — reaction/edit/delete frozen; channel/dm DEFERRED (ENG-96/110).** `vectors.json` grew 47→55, adding `reaction.added/removed` + `message.edited/deleted` byte-for-byte cases (Python and TS both pass; `VECTORS_SHA256` bumped in lock-step). `channel.created` / `dm.created` vectors are **deferred to ENG-110** — those types are Python/web-authored today with no cross-language hash consumer at stake yet, so freezing them now would be premature.
- **M3.5 file-referential amendments (ENG-117, additive):** the file-attachment security model, resolved against the merged ENG-116 reality. **No envelope field and no locked D-decision changed; NO `PROJECTION_VERSION` bump and no migration** — nothing rebuildable was added. This supersedes the pre-ENG-116 §6 "orphan-until-attached / a projection sets `files.stream_id`" framing **and** the original wording of this ticket (which mistakenly called for a `file.uploaded` reducer/projection that attaches `files.stream_id` and a `PROJECTION_VERSION 4→5` bump).
  1. **`files.stream_id` is OPERATIONAL, not projected (ENG-116).** It is bound at `POST /v1/files/initiate` under a write-access gate and read directly by download authz (`GET /v1/files/{file_id}`) — it is the single authoritative binding. There is deliberately **NO server projection that writes `files.stream_id`** (a second authoritative writer would be a split-brain hazard), so the download-authz binding never depends on projection state or a rebuild.
  2. **`file.uploaded` gets NO server projection handler** — it stays a D9 no-op in `apply_projection` (unhandled type → skipped, like a meta event). Its server role is purely a **durable, replicated log record** (the client attachment projection is ENG-120) **plus accept-time referential validation**.
  3. **Accept-time referential validation → `unknown_file` (ENG-117).** A new closed `RejectionCode` value. A `file.uploaded` (its `payload.file_id`) and every `message.created.file_ids` entry must resolve to a **PRESENT** file **uploaded by the author** in the event's **homed stream**; `file.uploaded` additionally pins **content identity** (`sha256` + `size_bytes` must equal the reserved row's — `name`/`mime_type` are display-only and deliberately not gated). Every non-qualifying shape (absent / not-present / other-author / other-workspace / other-stream / content mismatch) collapses to the **identical, non-disclosing** `unknown_file` (D13), so the file binding is never a cross-stream/cross-tenant existence oracle — in particular a `message.created` cannot borrow or re-home a file whose `files.stream_id` is a private stream the author cannot legitimately learn about. A mixed `file_ids` list with one bad id rejects the whole event.
  4. **No new rebuildable surface, so the equivalence gate is unchanged.** The client attachment projection + its windowed invariant-6 rebuild gate are **ENG-120**. The simulation gained two ops (`UploadFile`, `AttachToMessage`, driving the real Files API + `message.created.file_ids`) and an adversary file-attach isolation probe (attach-into-private blocked at the stream gate; borrowing another stream's file binding → `unknown_file`); the permission-isolation invariant now also asserts every accepted `file_ids` entry resolves to a present `files` row in that message's stream.
