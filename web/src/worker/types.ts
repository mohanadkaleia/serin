 * App-level version guarding the *derived* tables (`messages`, `reactions`,

 * rebuild of the derived tables from the raw `events` cache; it does NOT touch
 * the IndexedDB index layout (that is the Dexie `version()` number in `db.ts`).
 * See TDD §5.2, D-4.
 *
 * ENG-126, D3 (message-class rationale): `read_state` and `prefs` are SYNCED-KV
 * tables — server-authoritative per-user state pulled from `/v1/read-state` and
 * `/v1/prefs`, NOT derivable from the message `events` log. They are therefore
 * REBUILD-EXEMPT (absent from {@link DERIVED_TABLES} / `clearDerivedTables`): a
 * projection-version bump must never wipe them, or the badges would silently
 * un-read on a shape-skew boot until the next sync. Contrast ephemeral
 * presence/typing, which are memory-only and never persisted at all. The two
 * version numbers stay orthogonal: adding the `prefs` Dexie table is an
 * additive `version(4)` INDEX-layout change and must NOT bump this
 * PROJECTION-VALIDITY number (an accidental bump needlessly drops + rebuilds
 * every derived table on all clients).
 */
// ENG-81 bumped 1 → 2: `MessageRow` gained the `state`/`error_code` lifecycle
// fields and rebuild now re-derives pending rows from `outbox`, so shape-change
// clients rebuild the derived tables on boot.
// ENG-100 bumped 2 → 3 (M3 client projections): `MessageRow` gained the
// `edited_seq` / `deleted` / `reply_count` / `last_reply_seq` columns, and the
// derived set gained the `reactions` + `thread_participants` tables. Mirroring
// the server (its `PROJECTION_VERSION` is 4 after ENG-97/98/99), a shape/handler
// change bumps this so shape-skew clients drop + rebuild the derived tables from
// the raw `events` cache (+ re-derive pending overlay from `outbox`) on boot.
// ENG-100 bumped 3 → 4 (out-of-order fix): the `reactions` row shape changed from
// a bare membership to seq-aware LWW (`last_event_seq` + `present`, keeping
// tombstone rows) so reactions converge under the client's out-of-order
// (cold-window + backfill) delivery. A row-shape change → drop + rebuild reactions
// from `events` on boot (no Dexie index change — the new fields are unindexed).
// ENG-120 bumped 4 → 5 (client `file.uploaded` projection): the derived set gained
// the `files` table (a keyed upsert mirror of `file.uploaded`, keyed by `file_id`)
// and `MessageRow` gained the client-only `file_ids` display column (projected from
// the `message.created` body). A shape/derived-set change bumps this so existing
// clients drop + rebuild the derived tables from the raw `events` cache on boot —
// which is what populates the new `files` table + backfills `MessageRow.file_ids`.
