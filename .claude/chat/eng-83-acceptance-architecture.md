# ENG-83 — M2 §12 acceptance architecture (all six invariants green in CI)

The M2 hard gate (TDD §13): all six §12 invariants asserted green in CI. This
note captures the central design call — how the acceptance suite is split across
two languages — and justifies each choice. It is committed BEFORE the
implementation so the architecture is reviewable independent of the code.

## The six invariants (TDD §12, verbatim intent)

1. **Idempotency** — duplicate uploads never create duplicate events; retried
   mid-flight sends converge to exactly one accepted event.
2. **Convergence** — all clients' projections are byte-identical to each other
   and to a fresh rebuild-from-pull.
3. **Cursor integrity** — reconnect after arbitrary missed events yields
   gapless, duplicate-free per-stream sequences.
4. **Permission isolation** — a non-member observes zero private-stream data via
   pull, sync heads, search, files, or WS fanout (adversary client, every run).
5. **Pending settling** — optimistic messages end in correct server order with
   no lost/duplicated renders (asserted at the projection layer).
6. **Rebuild equivalence** — dropping projections and replaying equals
   incremental state — client (Dexie) **and** server (`messages_proj`) both.

## The central call: a cross-language split, NOT a rewrite (lean option (a))

The M1 harness (`server/tests/simulation/`, ENG-71) already asserts 1–4 on every
hypothesis example against a REAL in-process server + ephemeral Postgres. Its
docstrings explicitly frame invariants 5 and the client half of 6 as *documented
seams* to be extended at M2, and note "M2 extends this suite rather than
rewriting it." We take that at its word.

**Why split by language rather than unify.** Invariants 1–4 are *server*
properties — they are about what the server stores, sequences, and refuses to
disclose. They are only meaningful against the real Python/Postgres server, and
the Python hypothesis harness already drives N simulated clients + an adversary
against it. Invariants 5 and the client half of 6 are *client* properties — they
are about the browser's optimistic-render layer and its Dexie rebuild. They only
exist in the TypeScript worker (`WorkerCore`/`outbox`/`projection`/`db`). There
is no single process that owns both halves; forcing them into one harness would
mean either (a) reimplementing the TS client logic in Python (a model that proves
nothing about the shipping code) or (b) booting a browser to assert server
sequencing (slow, and redundant with the Python sim). The honest, minimal
architecture asserts each property in the language that owns it.

### Ownership map

| Invariant | Owner | Where |
|---|---|---|
| 1 Idempotency | Python sim | `server/tests/simulation/` (unchanged) |
| 2 Convergence | Python sim | `server/tests/simulation/` (unchanged) |
| 3 Cursor integrity | Python sim | `server/tests/simulation/` (unchanged) |
| 4 Permission isolation | Python sim | `server/tests/simulation/` (unchanged) |
| 5 Pending settling | **TS property suite (new)** | `web/tests/unit/worker/invariant5-pending-settling.property.spec.ts` |
| 6 client (Dexie rebuild≡incremental) | **TS property suite (new)** | `web/tests/unit/worker/invariant6-client-rebuild.property.spec.ts` |
| 6 server (`messages_proj` rebuild≡incremental) | Python equivalence gate | `cli/tests/test_equivalence_gate.py` + `server/tests/test_equivalence_gate_server.py` (unchanged) |

The Python side is **verify-don't-rewrite** (STEP 3): confirmed green against the
current M2 server before writing a line of the TS suite (1–4 + both equivalence
gates: green).

## Drive the REAL engine, never a reimplementation

The single most important discipline: the TS property tests exercise the ACTUAL
shipping code, not a parallel model of it.

- Invariant 5 drives a **real `WorkerCore`** (`new WorkerCore(db, sink, { http,
  wsFactory })`) via the established browser-free seam: an injected
  `FakeHttpClient` backed by the hermetic `FakeSyncServer` (the same server
  model the ENG-79/81 unit suites use — real per-stream sequencing, real
  `event_id` UNIQUE idempotency), an injected `FakeWsFactory` for the WS race,
  and the real default projection seam. Sends go through the real RPC surface
  (`core.handle(..., { t:'req', req:{ method:'mutate', params:{ m:'outbox.send'
  … } } })`), settle through the real `Outbox.runDrain`/`settle`/`reject`, and
  land in the real `messages` projection via the real `applyEventsToProjection`.
  Nothing about the message lifecycle is re-modelled in the test — the test only
  *generates histories* and *asserts invariants on the resulting DB state*.

- Invariant 6 client drives the real `applyEventsToProjection` (incremental) and
  the real `rebuildProjections` (`clearDerivedTables` → `rebuildMessagesProjection`
  from `events` + `applyOutboxToProjection` from `outbox`) — the exact functions
  db.ts calls on a stale `PROJECTION_VERSION` boot. The dump under comparison is
  the real `dumpMessages`. A test that re-derived rows itself would prove nothing;
  it asserts the shipping incremental path and the shipping rebuild path agree.

A property test that re-implements the logic under test is worthless — it proves
the test author can write the algorithm twice, not that the code is correct. Both
suites are strictly *black-box over the real modules*.

## Invariant 6 client: exercise the REAL Dexie path, not only MemoryDb

`MemoryDb` is a test double (a `Map`-backed `MsgDb`); the code that SHIPS in the
browser is `DexieDb` over IndexedDB. The permanent gate must cover the real path,
so:

- The randomized property loop (many fast-check cases) runs against **`MemoryDb`**
  for speed — hundreds of rebuild cycles per run stay sub-second.
- **AND** every generated history is *also* asserted at least once against the
  **real `DexieDb`** on `fake-indexeddb` (the same `openDb(fakeIdbOptions())`
  path the existing `projection-equivalence.spec.ts` uses under `describe.each`).
  Concretely: a dedicated gating assertion replays a fast-check-drawn history
  through `DexieDb` and asserts `rebuild === incremental` byte-equal — so the
  shipping IndexedDB rebuild (compound-index ordering, `bulkPut` upsert
  semantics, the real `clearDerivedTables` transaction) is what the gate holds.

This is the justification for the two-tier structure: MemoryDb gives breadth
(many random cases cheaply); DexieDb gives fidelity (the bytes that ship). Both
are required; neither alone is sufficient. Invariant 5's ack-vs-WS race and the
DexieDb assertion also both run through the real engine, so `MemoryDb` is never
the *only* thing gated for either invariant.

## Property-testing library: `fast-check`

Added as a `web` devDependency. It is the de-facto TS property-testing library
(the analogue of Python's `hypothesis` the Python sim already uses), with
shrinking so a failing case reduces to a minimal reproduction. The generators:

- **Invariant 5** generates a randomized *command script* over multiple streams:
  `send`, `ack-drain` (release a paused batch so queued sends settle),
  `reject-next-send` (configure the FakeSyncServer to reject a send → parked
  `failed`), and `ws-race` (server processes a send and emits its WS frame before
  vs after the client's batch POST completes — both arrival orders). fast-check
  draws the command sequence, the stream each send targets, and the race order.
  The invariant is asserted on the terminal DB state after every drawn script.
  The WS frame is the FULL wire envelope with a REAL `event_hash` (the stored
  `hashEvent(body)`, via `server.wireFor(...)` / `emitEvent(...)` — the outbox
  §9 pattern), because the real sync engine hash-verifies inbound frames and
  DROPS any mismatch. The property PROVES the frame is genuinely applied, not
  silently dropped: the `ws-first` arm (batch still paused) asserts the events
  cache grows by exactly the raced event, and a `console.warn` spy asserts ZERO
  hash-mismatch drops across the whole run. A regression to a fabricated hash
  makes the events-count guard fail — the race can never go vacuous again.

- **Invariant 6 client** generates a randomized *event history*: N streams, each
  with a drawn sequence of `message.created` v1 events (varying text incl.
  unicode, optional `thread_root_id`/`mentions`, `plain`/`markdown`) interleaved
  with D9-skip events (unknown types, v≥2, meta), PLUS a drawn set of outbox rows
  (pending/failed, and the crash-orphaned "settled but still in outbox" case).
  Apply incrementally → snapshot `dumpMessages` → drop derived tables → rebuild →
  assert byte-equal.

## The six-green union as the CI gate

`.github/workflows/ci.yml` gains explicit, named coverage so each invariant is
*visibly* asserted (a reviewer can point at the step that owns each one):

- **`checks` job** (existing, Python/uv) keeps the named
  `Equivalence gate (rebuild ≡ incremental)` (CLI, inv 6 server) +
  `Equivalence gate (server · rebuild ≡ incremental)` (Postgres, inv 6 server) +
  `Simulation suite` (inv 1–4) steps, byte-for-byte. These already gate 1–4 and
  the server half of 6.
- **`web` job** (existing, Node/pnpm) runs `pnpm test`, which now *includes* the
  two new property suites — so invariant 5 and the client half of 6 gate on every
  push. A dedicated named step **`Invariant suite (§12 — pending-settling +
  client rebuild)`** runs *only* the two property spec files as a separately
  visible signal (in addition to their inclusion in the full `pnpm test`), so
  "invariant suite red" is a distinct diagnosis from "some other web test red".
- **`e2e` job** (new, separate, heavier) runs the Playwright golden path against a
  real built Vue app (`vite preview`) + a real `msgd` server (Postgres
  testcontainer-style ephemeral DB + subprocess uvicorn, the exact mechanism
  `cli/tests/_e2e_server.py` uses for the M1 exit gate). Kept a separate job
  because it installs browsers + boots a server — the slow tail should not gate
  the fast unit signal.

**Six-invariant → CI-step mapping (the gate):**

| # | Invariant | CI job · step |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | Idempotency | `checks` · Simulation suite |
| 2 | Convergence | `checks` · Simulation suite |
| 3 | Cursor integrity | `checks` · Simulation suite |
| 4 | Permission isolation | `checks` · Simulation suite |
| 5 | Pending settling | `web` · Invariant suite (§12) + Unit tests |
| 6 | Rebuild equivalence — client | `web` · Invariant suite (§12) + Unit tests |
| 6 | Rebuild equivalence — server | `checks` · Equivalence gate (CLI + server) |

All six are green when the `checks` and `web` jobs are green — that conjunction
IS the M2/M3 gate.

## Teeth (acceptance criterion): the suite provably catches a real regression

A gate that passes vacuously is worthless. We follow the ENG-61/71 mutation
discipline: a deliberately-injected client bug must turn the suite RED.

- The existing `projection-equivalence.spec.ts` already carries an inline TEETH
  case for invariant 6 (corrupt one row on the rebuild pass only → dumps differ).
  We preserve it and add property-level teeth.
- **Env-gated mutation, checked in and green-by-default.** An env var
  `MSG_MUTATE` (read only inside the test files) can flip one of two well-known
  client bugs into the engine's *observed behavior within the test*:
  - `MSG_MUTATE=inv5-drop-ack` — the invariant-5 harness, after a settle, deletes
    the settled projection row (models a client that loses an acked message). The
    property "every accepted send is exactly one settled row" then fails.
  - `MSG_MUTATE=inv6-rebuild-skew` — the invariant-6 harness monkeypatches the
    `message.created@1` HANDLER on the rebuild pass only to mutate one row's
    `text` (the ENG-61 pattern), so `rebuild !== incremental`.
  With `MSG_MUTATE` unset (CI default) both suites are green. A reviewer runs
  `MSG_MUTATE=inv5-drop-ack pnpm test invariant5` (or `inv6-rebuild-skew …
  invariant6`) to watch the suite go red — proving the assertions have teeth
  without shipping a red test. The exact commands + the observed failures are
  documented in the PR body.

## Results — teeth proven, infra findings

**Teeth (proven, both directions):**

- `MSG_MUTATE=inv5-drop-ack pnpm test invariant5` → RED. The mutant db drops the
  settled row on `putMessages`; the invariant catches it as a leftover `pending`
  row: `AssertionError: expected 'pending' to be undefined`
  (`Counterexample: [[{stream:0,reject:false,race:"none"}]]`).
- `MSG_MUTATE=inv6-rebuild-skew pnpm test invariant6` → RED. The rebuild-only
  HANDLER corruption makes one row's `text` differ, so `rebuild !== incremental`:
  `AssertionError: expected '{"message_id":"m_1"…' to be '{"message_id":"m_1"…'`.
- With `MSG_MUTATE` unset (CI default) both suites are GREEN (348 web tests pass).

**Infra findings baked into the harness (Playwright):**

1. **uvicorn WS subprotocol / bearer auth — RESOLVED by ENG-92.** The server
   authenticates the WS via `Sec-WebSocket-Protocol: bearer, <token>` read from
   `scope["subprotocols"]`. Originally, uvicorn's default `websockets` backend
   surfaced the offered subprotocols as the raw, *un-split* header value —
   `["bearer, <token>"]` — while `wsproto` / the in-process ASGI test transport
   pre-split into `["bearer", "<token>"]`. The server's `_bearer_token` required
   ≥2 elements, so under the default backend it saw one element, returned None,
   and closed pre-accept (4401 → HTTP 403) even with a valid token (the same
   token authorized `GET /v1/sync` 200 — only the WS handshake failed). This only
   surfaced against a real uvicorn subprocess; the ENG-68 WS tests all run
   in-process (ASGI transport), so they never exercised it. **ENG-92 fixed it
   server-side**: `_bearer_token` now normalizes *both* shapes (split each
   subprotocol element on commas + strip OWS), so the default `websockets`
   backend authenticates the bearer subprotocol out of the box. The e2e harness
   therefore runs the server with its **default/shipped ws backend (no `--ws`
   override)** — the golden-path live-WS leg certifies the real default self-host
   config, not a workaround.
2. **Same-origin topology (no proxy).** vite's `preview` proxy does not forward
   the WS subprotocol header either, so rather than proxy, the harness serves the
   built SPA directly from msgd (`MSG_SERVE_SPA` + `MSG_WEB_DIST_DIR`) — the
   production topology (one origin for HTML + API + WS). More faithful and
   proxy-free.
3. **Sidebar wiring gap (fixed).** The workspace store loaded the sidebar once at
   mount, before the sync catch-up pull populated `streams`; its per-stream
   `{kind:'stream'}` subscriptions cannot cover a stream that does not exist yet,
   so a freshly-synced `general` never appeared until a reload. Fixed minimally:
   the store also re-queries `streams.list` on every `{kind:'sync'}` push. The
   golden path surfaced this real M2 integration bug.
4. **Channel bootstrap.** `POST /v1/setup` creates only `workspace-meta`; a
   channel is born from a `channel.created` event. The harness bootstraps the
   owner + a public `general` via `msgctl` before the browser runs, so the golden
   path just logs in.

## Branch protection (flag for a human)

Marking the gate "required" in GitHub branch protection is a repo-settings change
that may be outside automation scope. The exact required checks to mark are the
job names: **`lint · type · test`** (the `checks` job — inv 1–4 + 6-server) and
**`web · lint · type · test · build`** (the `web` job — inv 5 + 6-client). The
Playwright `e2e` job should also be marked required for M3. This is called out in
the PR body for the human to set in repo settings.
