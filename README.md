# msg

**Best-in-class team messaging where the workspace is portable, self-hostable, scriptable, and syncs like Git.**

msg is a local-first, file-based team messaging app for 5–50-person technical teams. The source of truth is an **append-only event log**; every rendering surface — server tables, client caches, search — is a **rebuildable projection** of it. A self-hosted sync server validates, sequences, stores, and fans out events; clients replicate per-stream and render locally.

> **Local-first *architecture* is universal. Local-first *storage* is per-platform.**
> The protocol (client-minted event IDs, per-stream cursors, idempotent upload, outbox, projection rebuild) applies to every client. The files (NDJSON logs, SQLite, "workspace is a folder") live on the server as the export format, and later on the desktop client.

## Status

**M0 — Protocol spike: complete** (tagged [`m0`](https://github.com/mohanadkaleia/msg/releases/tag/m0)). The event protocol is proven end-to-end in miniature: envelope schema locked, cross-language hash vectors frozen, and the rebuild ≡ incremental equivalence gate running permanently in CI.

**M1 — Sync server: complete** (tagged `m1`). msg is now a client-server system: token auth + sessions + single-use invites, streams + membership with a §3.6 read/write permission predicate, a `workspace-meta` stream, idempotent batch upload with gapless per-stream sequencing, pull/sync bootstrap, permission-scoped WebSocket fanout, Postgres + Alembic migrations, one-command compose self-host, and a simulation-suite skeleton (four of six §12 invariants) green in CI. The M1 exit gate proves two `msgctl` clients converge over the *real* server under interleaved bidirectional traffic.

**M2 — Web client + sync proof: complete** (tagged `m2`). There is now a browser client: a Vue shell (sidebar, virtualized message list, plain-textarea composer, Cmd+K workspace switcher) backed by a SharedWorker that owns the session token, the authed HTTP client, the sync engine, the Dexie projection cache, and an optimistic-send outbox that drains on reconnect. Reads are instant and local (the projection); sends render optimistically and settle under their hash-bound `stream_id`. The Docker image now **bakes the built SPA** and serves it single-origin from the same origin as `/v1` — `docker compose up -d --build` yields a working web client at `http://localhost:8080`. The M2 exit gate is **all six §12 invariants green in CI** (Python sim owns 1–4 + server rebuild-equivalence; a TS `fast-check` suite owns pending-settling + client Dexie rebuild-equivalence, driving the real worker) plus a Playwright golden path — login → send → reload → history intact → a second browser sees the message live via WS fanout — on uvicorn's **default** WebSocket backend (ENG-92).

## The protocol in one paragraph

Every event is an envelope with a client-authored `body` and server-assigned `server` metadata. `event_hash = sha256(JCS(body))` — SHA-256 over the [RFC 8785](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc8785) canonicalization of the body only; the server never mutates an accepted body. All entity IDs are typed ULIDs (`w_`, `u_`, `s_`, `m_`, `f_`, `d_`), client-mintable and offline-safe. The server assigns a **gapless, monotonic `server_sequence` per stream**; a gap means data loss, not permissions. Uploads are idempotent by `event_id` — retries can never duplicate. Unknown event types are preserved in the log, skipped in projections, and never crash anything. The canonical JSON test vectors that every implementation (Python today, TypeScript at M2) must pass byte-for-byte are frozen in [`server/msgd/core/testdata/vectors.json`](server/msgd/core/testdata/vectors.json); JSON Schemas for the envelope and payloads are published in [`docs/schemas/`](docs/schemas/).

## Quickstart (M0: local workspace via `msgctl`)

The offline story — no server. Requires Python 3.12 and [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/).

```bash
uv sync

# Create a workspace folder
uv run msgctl init ./demo

# Append messages (envelope built, hashed, sequenced, fsync'd — one NDJSON line per event)
uv run msgctl send ./demo --stream general --text "hello, world"
uv run msgctl send ./demo --stream general --text "second message"

# Materialize the SQLite projection incrementally (idempotent — run it twice)
uv run msgctl project ./demo

# Drop the projection and replay the whole log (temp DB + atomic swap)
uv run msgctl rebuild ./demo

# Recompute every hash, check gapless sequences, validate schemas
uv run msgctl verify ./demo            # human report
uv run msgctl verify ./demo --json     # machine-readable, CI-friendly exit codes
```

The workspace is just a folder: `workspace.json` plus `streams/<stream_id>/<YYYY-MM>.ndjson` — the same tree the M4 export format uses. `verify` is the ownership pitch made testable: it re-derives every `event_hash` from the stored bytes and proves per-stream sequence contiguity.

## Quickstart (M1: self-hosted server + `msgctl` remote)

The client-server story — one operator self-hosts the sync server; each teammate binds a local workspace to it and syncs.

**1. Bring up the server** (Postgres + the sync daemon) via Docker Compose. See [`docs/deploy.md`](docs/deploy.md) for the full guide.

```bash
cp .env.example .env          # fill in MSG_SECRET_KEY and the Postgres password
docker compose up -d          # starts Postgres + runs migrations + serves the API
curl -fsS http://localhost:8080/healthz   # -> {"status":"ok"}
```

Compose binds the API to **`127.0.0.1:8080`** (loopback only, deliberately — Docker port-publishing bypasses host firewalls, so a `0.0.0.0` bind would expose the plain-HTTP API on every interface; front it with the TLS reverse proxy in [`docs/deploy.md`](docs/deploy.md)).

**2. The owner sets up the workspace** and mints an invite for a teammate:

```bash
# First run: create the workspace + owner account (also creates the public `general`)
uv run msgctl login ./acme --setup \
  --server-url http://localhost:8080 \
  --email owner@example.com --password '…' \
  --workspace-name Acme --display-name Owner

uv run msgctl send ./acme --stream general --text "hello from the owner"
uv run msgctl push ./acme                       # upload queued events to the server

uv run msgctl invite ./acme --role member       # prints a single-use join URL
```

**3. A teammate joins** with the invite token and syncs:

```bash
uv run msgctl login ./bob --invite-token <token-from-the-join-url> \
  --server-url http://localhost:8080 \
  --email bob@example.com --password '…' --display-name Bob

uv run msgctl pull ./bob                          # mirror the server's streams locally
uv run msgctl send ./bob --stream general --text "hi, owner"
uv run msgctl push ./bob
uv run msgctl pull ./acme                          # owner sees Bob's message
```

`push` is only a hint that new events are queued; **cursors are the truth** — `pull` is idempotent and drives every client to the same gapless per-stream sequence the server assigned. Run `verify` on any synced workspace to re-derive every `event_hash` from the stored bytes, exactly as in M0. These are the same commands the M1 exit-gate E2E drives to prove two clients converge over the real server.

## Quickstart (M2: the web client, single-origin)

The browser story — the same self-hosted server now **serves the web client from its own origin**. The Docker image bakes the built SPA into the runtime, so no separate web host, CDN, or CORS config is needed: the API and the client share `http://localhost:8080`.

**1. Bring up the server *with the SPA baked in*.** The `--build` is what compiles the client into the image (a fresh multi-stage Node build → `/app/web/dist`, served at `/`):

```bash
cp .env.example .env               # fill in MSG_SECRET_KEY + POSTGRES_PASSWORD (as in M1)
docker compose up -d --build       # builds the SPA into the image, migrates, serves
curl -fsS http://localhost:8080/healthz   # -> {"status":"ok"}
curl -fsS http://localhost:8080/           # -> the SPA index.html (single-origin)
```

**2. Bootstrap the owner + workspace** with the M1 `msgctl … --setup` flow (the server has no self-serve signup — the owner is minted from the CLI):

```bash
uv run msgctl login ./acme --setup \
  --server-url http://localhost:8080 \
  --email owner@example.com --password '…' \
  --workspace-name Acme --display-name Owner
```

**3. Open the client** at **http://localhost:8080** and log in as `owner@example.com`. You land in `#general`; send a message — it renders **optimistically** the instant you hit send (the outbox holds it as *pending*), then settles to *acked* once the server sequences it. Reads are instant because they come from the local Dexie projection, not a round-trip.

**4. Prove live sync across two browsers.** Mint an invite and hand the join URL to a second user:

```bash
uv run msgctl invite ./acme --role member
# -> {"url": "http://localhost:8080/join/<token>", "expires_at": "..."}
```

Open the printed **join URL** (`http://localhost:8080/join/<token>`) in a second browser or an incognito window — it loads the accept-invite page, where the teammate sets a display name, email, and password to create their account and join the workspace. (Opening the bare `http://localhost:8080` would just redirect to the login page — a brand-new teammate has no account yet, so the `/join/<token>` link is what registers them.) Now post from either side — the other browser receives it **live via WebSocket fanout** (no reload), on uvicorn's default WS backend. Kill the network mid-send and the outbox holds your message as pending; restore it and the drain loop flushes it — reads stay instant and local throughout.

**The Cmd+K switcher.** Press <kbd>Cmd</kbd>+<kbd>K</kbd> (<kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>K</kbd>) to fuzzy-jump between channels/workspaces without leaving the keyboard.

> The M2 build is an **online-first** web client (full browser NDJSON/offline is desktop M6, D4). "Offline-ish" means the outbox survives a transient disconnect and drains on reconnect, and every read is served from the local projection — not that the app runs fully offline.

## Development

```bash
uv sync
uv run pytest                  # full suite
uv run ruff check .
uv run ruff format --check .
uv run mypy
```

CI runs all of the above on every push and PR, plus a dedicated **`Equivalence gate (rebuild ≡ incremental)`** step — a hypothesis property test proving that dropping the projection and replaying the log always reproduces the incremental state byte-for-byte. That gate is the M0 exit criterion and is kept forever (TDD §5); it extends to server projections at M1 and the browser cache at M2. At M1 the `pytest` step also runs the `integration`-marked E2Es — including the exit-gate test that stands up a real Postgres + the live server and drives two `msgctl` clients to convergence — and a separate **`Simulation suite`** step runs the §12 property-based harness (four of six invariants at M1).

### The M2 hard gate — all six §12 invariants green in CI

M2's exit criterion (TDD §13) is that **all six §12 invariants** are asserted green in CI. They are split across two languages, each owning the property in the language it lives in (see [`.claude/chat/eng-83-acceptance-architecture.md`](.claude/chat/eng-83-acceptance-architecture.md)):

| # | Invariant | CI job · step |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | Idempotency | `lint · type · test` · **Simulation suite** |
| 2 | Convergence | `lint · type · test` · **Simulation suite** |
| 3 | Cursor integrity | `lint · type · test` · **Simulation suite** |
| 4 | Permission isolation | `lint · type · test` · **Simulation suite** |
| 5 | Pending settling | `web · lint · type · test · build` · **Invariant suite (§12)** |
| 6 | Rebuild equivalence — client (Dexie) | `web · lint · type · test · build` · **Invariant suite (§12)** |
| 6 | Rebuild equivalence — server (`messages_proj`) | `lint · type · test` · **Equivalence gate** |

Invariants 5 and client-6 are [`fast-check`](https://github.com/dubzzz/fast-check) property suites that drive the **real** worker engine (`web/tests/unit/worker/invariant{5,6}-*.property.spec.ts`). The `e2e · golden path` job additionally runs a Playwright smoke over the real production stack (login → send → reload → history intact → a second browser sees the message live via WS fanout). The suites have **teeth**: `MSG_MUTATE=inv5-drop-ack` and `MSG_MUTATE=inv6-rebuild-skew` flip in a client bug that turns the respective suite red (green by default).

> **Live WS on the default self-host config (ENG-92, resolved).** The "second browser sees the message live via WS fanout" leg runs against uvicorn's **default/shipped `websockets` backend** — exactly what a real self-host runs — with **no `--ws` override**. ENG-92 fixed the server's bearer-subprotocol WS auth to normalize the un-split `["bearer, <token>"]` that the default backend surfaces in the ASGI scope, so the WS upgrade authenticates out of the box. Live sync is therefore certified on the default config, not a workaround.

**Required checks (branch protection).** The M2/M3 gate is the conjunction of the jobs whose names are **`lint · type · test`** (inv 1–4 + server-6), **`web · lint · type · test · build`** (inv 5 + client-6), and **`e2e · golden path`**. Marking these "required" in GitHub branch protection is a repo-settings change (outside CI-file scope) — a maintainer must set it.

Contribution conventions: work is tracked in Linear (`ENG-xx`); commits follow `<type>[ENG-xx]: description`; protocol changes require amending `docs/technical-design.md`, not drive-by PRs — the D1–D14 decision table is the contract.
