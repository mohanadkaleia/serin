"""``rebuild_projections`` — drop ``messages_proj`` and replay ``events`` (ENG-69).

The Postgres analogue of the M0 ``msgctl rebuild``.  M0 rebuilt into a temp
SQLite file and ``os.replace``-swapped it, because a SQLite DB *is* a file;
Postgres cannot rename a table, so the atomicity primitive changes from *rename*
to **transaction / MVCC**:

**Single-transaction ``TRUNCATE messages_proj`` + streamed replay, committed once.**

* **Atomic by MVCC.** Until the single ``COMMIT``, concurrent readers see the
  pre-rebuild snapshot; after commit they see the fully-rebuilt state.  There is
  never a partial projection — the Postgres analogue of ENG-59's "an interrupted
  rebuild leaves the previous projection intact".
* **Safe to interrupt.** Any exception / kill before ``COMMIT`` rolls the whole
  txn back and ``messages_proj`` is untouched.  Delivered by the txn boundary
  instead of ``os.replace``.
* **Rebuild ≡ incremental by construction.** Replay reuses the *exact* same
  :func:`~msgd.projections.apply.apply_projection` the accept path uses.  A
  single source of apply is what makes the equivalence true (M0 rebuild reused
  ``project``; we reuse ``apply_projection``).

Replay order ``(stream_id, server_sequence)`` is fixed for reproducibility.  The
final state is order-independent (``message_id`` is immutable, ``ON CONFLICT DO
NOTHING``), but a deterministic order keeps a single run reproducible.

**Locking property (M1, documented).**  ``TRUNCATE`` takes an ``ACCESS
EXCLUSIVE`` lock, briefly blocking concurrent reads of ``messages_proj`` for the
rebuild's duration.  Acceptable for a single-operator admin op at M1 scale.  If
read-during-rebuild concurrency ever matters, ``DELETE FROM messages_proj``
(ROW EXCLUSIVE, MVCC-invisible to other snapshots until commit) is the drop-in
alternative — noted, not chosen now.
