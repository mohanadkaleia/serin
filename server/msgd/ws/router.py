"""``GET /v1/ws`` — the authenticated WebSocket surface: fanout target + heartbeat.

Flow (§7):

1. **Auth, pre-accept.** The bearer token arrives via ``Sec-WebSocket-Protocol:
   bearer, <token>`` — surfaced as ``websocket.scope["subprotocols"]`` — **not** the
   query string. The exact list *shape* is backend-dependent (ENG-92: uvicorn's
   default ``websockets`` backend yields the un-split ``["bearer, <token>"]``, while
   ``wsproto`` / the ASGI test transport yield ``["bearer", "<token>"]``); see
   :func:`_bearer_token`, which normalizes both. This overturns the plan's ``?token=…``
   after security round 1 (finding b): a query token leaks the raw session token
   into ``uvicorn.error`` request-line logs (and any proxy access log / browser
   history / ``Referer``), defeating ENG-64 D2. The subprotocol form is the
   idiomatic browser-WS bearer pattern (``new WebSocket(url, ["bearer", token])``)
   and keeps the secret out of the URL entirely — do **not** "clean up" back to a
   query param. The raw token is subprotocol-safe (``token_urlsafe`` → tchar-clean,
   no padding). Resolve it exactly as ``require_auth`` does — ``hash_token`` +
   ``lookup_session`` + the same expiry/deactivation checks + the throttled
   ``bump_session`` (D4) — using the standard, test-overridable ``get_session``.
   Any failure (missing/malformed subprotocol, unknown/expired token, deactivated
   user) closes the socket **before** ``accept()`` with app code ``4401`` (uniform,
   non-disclosing). Session-loading is re-called inline rather than factored out of
   the merged ``deps.require_auth``.
2. **Accept + register (cap, §5).** ``accept(subprotocol="bearer")`` — the echo is
   REQUIRED or a real browser aborts the handshake — then register in the hub. Over
   the per-user cap → accept-then-close ``4029`` (so the client receives the code).
3. **Serve.** Two concurrent coroutines for the socket's lifetime — a tolerant
   receive loop (client ``ping`` → server ``pong``; client ``pong`` clears the
   outstanding-ping flag; every other frame ignored, D9) and a 30 s heartbeat
   (send ``ping``; if the previous one is still unanswered, close ``4408``).
   Whichever ends first tears the other down; a single ``finally`` deregisters.

Identity-snapshot caveat (security round 1, hardening note 2): the connection
captures ``user_id``/``role``/``workspace_id``/``device_id`` at connect. **Stream
membership is live per-send** (the hub re-runs the read predicate on every event),
so a member removed from a channel stops receiving its fanout on the next event.
Session *revocation* and *workspace-role* changes are **not** re-checked mid-socket
— tearing a live socket down on those needs a hub signal that is M2/M3 work. So the
"instant revocation" property is scoped to stream membership, not session validity.

def _bearer_token(websocket: WebSocket) -> str | None:
    """Return the bearer token from a ``bearer, <token>`` subprotocol offer, else None.

    The token rides in ``Sec-WebSocket-Protocol: bearer, <token>``, surfaced by the
    ASGI server as ``scope["subprotocols"]``. Crucially, **different WS backends
    represent that list differently** (ENG-92):

    * uvicorn's default ``websockets`` sans-io backend surfaces the *raw, un-split*
      header value(s) — ``event.headers.get_all("Sec-WebSocket-Protocol")`` — so a
      ``bearer, <token>`` offer arrives as a **single** element ``["bearer, <token>"]``.
    * ``wsproto`` and the in-process Starlette/httpx ASGI test transport pre-split on
      commas, arriving as ``["bearer", "<token>"]`` (the transport may also leave a
      leading OWS: ``["bearer", " <token>"]``).

    So we normalize *both* shapes: split every element on commas and strip the RFC 7230
    optional whitespace (OWS), flattening to a canonical ``["bearer", "<token>"]``. A
    subprotocol token is ``tchar`` only (``token_urlsafe`` output has no whitespace or
    commas), so splitting/stripping is loss-free. A well-formed offer normalizes to
    exactly ``[_BEARER_SUBPROTOCOL, <token>]``; anything else (absent, ``["bearer"]``
    with no token, a non-``bearer`` first element) yields ``None`` → the uniform
    pre-accept ``4401``.

    Reading the raw ``scope["subprotocols"]`` without this flatten is the ENG-92 bug:
    under a real uvicorn on the default backend the single-element form failed the
    ``len >= 2`` check and 403'd a valid token, while the in-process WS tests (which
    use the pre-split transport) stayed green.
