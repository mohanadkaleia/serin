"""The process-global WebSocket hub: connection registry + permission-scoped fanout.

The :func:`msgd.events.fanout.publish_event` seam delegates here. On each newly
accepted event the hub resolves the recipient set **per-send against the live DB**
(the §3 central ruling) and pushes the wire frame to every eligible connected
socket, with per-socket error isolation and a per-send timeout (§4).

Why per-send DB resolution and no in-memory membership map (§3):

* It reuses the **one shared** ``readable_streams_predicate`` (permissions.py) that
  pull/search already use — a live ``EXISTS`` on ``stream_members`` — so fanout
  scoping cannot diverge from read scoping, and a removed member loses fanout on
  the **very next** event (instant revocation, zero cache-coherence code; §3.6,
  §12 invariant 4). The in-memory map is the documented post-M1 optimization.
* Delivery is a hint, not a guarantee (§3.3): a frame the predicate transiently
  mis-resolves during a membership race is simply a missed hint → the client
  re-pulls by cursor. That is what makes the simple live resolution safe.

Session acquisition (R1): the frozen seam carries no DB handle, so the hub owns an
**injectable** ``session_factory``. Production defaults to a fresh session from the
engine's process-wide sessionmaker (:func:`_production_session_scope`); the test
harness injects a factory yielding the bound, rolled-back per-test session so
fanout reads see the same transaction as the upload that triggered them.

Import-cycle note (R3): ``fanout.publish_event`` imports ``hub`` **function-locally**;
this module imports only ``events.permissions`` + ``core`` + ``db``, never
``events.fanout`` — a one-way edge, no cycle.
