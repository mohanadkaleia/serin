"""Pure WebSocket frame builders + protocol constants (TDD §3.3).

No socket I/O lives here — every helper is a pure transform, so frame shaping is
unit-testable without a connection (the §6a hash-fidelity guard runs directly
against :func:`event_frame`).

**Server → client frames (M1):**

* ``{"t": "event", "event": {envelope}}`` — a stored event, byte-shaped
  identically to the pull endpoint (``events_read._serialize_event``):
  ``{"body": <raw body>, "event_hash": <str>, "signature": null,
  "server": {"server_sequence", "server_received_at", "payload_redacted"}}``.
  Raw-body-faithful + hash-valid for **every** event, including unknown types.
* ``{"t": "pong"}`` — reply to a client ``{"t": "ping"}``.
* ``{"t": "ping"}`` — server heartbeat probe.

**Client → server frames:** ``{"t": "ping"}`` / ``{"t": "pong"}`` and the inbound
``{"t": "typing", "stream_id": …}`` signal (ENG-125). An inbound ``presence`` frame
stays IGNORED — presence is server-derived, never client-asserted. Any other /
unknown / malformed inbound frame is ignored (D9 tolerance).

**Signal-class ``t`` values** (the non-event surface, D3): server→client
``read_state`` (ENG-123, synced KV) / ``prefs`` (ENG-124, synced KV) / ``presence``
+ ``typing`` (ENG-125, EPHEMERAL — WS-only, never persisted/projected/exported).
All are named in ``RESERVED_*`` so each ticket *extends* rather than redefines the
``t`` space.
