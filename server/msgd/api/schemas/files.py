"""Request/response shapes for the Files API (``/v1/files/...``, ENG-116).

Three endpoints, three tiny models. Unlike the event-batch endpoint (which reads
its raw body so the client bytes reach ``hash_event`` untouched, ENG-66), the
Files API carries NO hashed-verbatim body, so binding a Pydantic model here is
safe and buys strict wire validation:

* ``sha256`` is pinned to the BlobStore's bare-lowercase-hex-64 domain (the same
  ``^[0-9a-f]{64}$`` the store validates before it builds any path) — a malformed
  digest is a 422 at the edge, and it is stream-INDEPENDENT so it discloses
  nothing about which streams exist (the 404-not-403 discipline is unaffected).
* ``name`` is capped at 255 UTF-8 BYTES (the frozen ``file.uploaded`` bound). It
  is otherwise arbitrary bytes — quotes, control chars, newlines are all allowed
  here and neutralized only when echoed into the ``Content-Disposition`` header on
  download (never interpolated raw — header-injection guard).
* ``size_bytes`` is a POSITIVE int (empty files disallowed — see the field note);
  the per-file cap is enforced in the handler against
  ``settings.file_max_size_bytes`` (it is config, not a wire constant) AFTER the
  authz gate, so it is never a stream-existence oracle.
