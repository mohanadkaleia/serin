"""``POST /v1/events/batch`` — the M1 write sequencer (TDD §3.2/§4.2, ENG-66).

This router **composes** the ENG-65 primitives (``emit_event`` -> reducer +
``insert_event``) behind the full §3.2 validation pipeline, per-event
accepted/rejected shaping, and idempotency. It owns the *write* half only;
ENG-67 owns the pull/sync routers (a filename that cannot collide).

Central rulings (see :mod:`msgd.events.validate` and the plan):

* **Raw-body capture (D2):** the handler takes a raw :class:`Request` — *no*
  bound Pydantic body param. The body is read once via ``request.body()`` (not
  ``request.json()``) so we control the exact byte length for the 1 MB cap and
  own JSON parse errors. Each item's ``body`` is hashed verbatim; no model ever
  touches it before it is hashed and stored.
* **Per-event transaction (D6):** a ``begin_nested()`` SAVEPOINT around
  ``emit_event`` (so a ``UNIQUE(workspace_id, event_id)`` violation is catchable
  without poisoning the session) plus a ``commit()`` **per accepted event**. The
  commit releases the ``streams`` row lock immediately, so concurrent batches to
  one stream serialize tightly into gapless sequences (§4.2). A rejected item
  opens no transaction; a bad event N cannot undo the already-committed N-1.
* **Idempotency (D7):** the UNIQUE violation is recovered by fetching the
  original row and returning its four ``accepted[]`` fields — the reducer is not
  re-run, the body is not re-hashed, and ``publish_event`` is not re-invoked.
* **Batch caps (D3):** body >1 MB -> 413 ``/problems/payload-too-large``;
  >100 events -> 422 ``/problems/batch-too-large``; malformed top-level JSON ->
  422 ``/problems/validation-error``. All three reject the whole request as
  problem+json, distinct from the per-event ``payload_too_large`` code (64 KB).
