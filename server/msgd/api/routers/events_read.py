"""``GET /v1/events`` — the pull endpoint: forward catch-up + backward backfill (ENG-67).

Cursors are the source of truth for the whole protocol (§3.2); the WS push is
only ever a hint (§3.3).  This endpoint serves one page of a stream's log, in a
direction chosen by which cursor is present:

======  ======  =============================================================
after   before  behavior
======  ======  =============================================================
set     unset   **forward catch-up** — ``server_sequence > after`` ascending
unset   set     **backward backfill** — newest page with ``server_sequence <
                before``, returned ascending
unset   unset   **first page from seq 1** (≡ ``after=0``) — the "from start"
                default
set     set     **422** ``/problems/invalid-cursor``
======  ======  =============================================================

Both directions return the page **ascending within the page** (ticket contract).
``has_more`` is direction-relative and computed from a single
``LIMIT effective+1`` SELECT (no second count query, so the flag is
snapshot-consistent with the page):

* **forward:** ``has_more`` ⇒ more **newer** events exist; the client advances
  with ``after = last_returned_seq``.
* **backward:** ``has_more`` ⇒ more **older** events exist; the client walks back
  with ``before = first_returned_seq``.

Cold-start protocol (§3.2):  a fresh device pulls ``GET /v1/sync``, then for each
visible stream fetches the **newest page** (``before = head_seq + 1``), renders
immediately, and backfills on scroll (``before = oldest_loaded``).
``workspace-meta`` alone is synced from sequence 1 (``after=0``) because the
client needs the full channel/member state; other streams are newest-page-first.
Forward catch-up (``after = last_contiguous_seq``) is the reconnect path.

No torn reads:  each request reads within one per-request snapshot (READ
COMMITTED), and the accept path bumps ``head_seq`` **and** inserts the event row
in the same transaction (D2) — so any ``head_seq = N`` a reader has seen implies
events ``1..N`` are already visible; a follow-up ``before = N+1`` cannot miss them.

**Serialization is raw (D1):** each event is assembled verbatim from DB row
values — the JSONB ``body`` straight through, ``event_hash`` / ``payload_redacted``
/ ``server_received_at`` from columns, ``signature`` reserved-null (no column).
It is **never** regenerated through ``core.Envelope`` / ``Body.model_dump``, so
``hash_event(response["body"]) == response["event_hash"]`` holds for **every**
event, including unknown-type events (opaque bodies survive untouched).
