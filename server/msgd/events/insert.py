"""``insert_event`` — the minimal server-side event-insert primitive (ENG-65 D1).

This is the sequence-assignment + row-insert + hash primitive that ENG-66's
``POST /v1/events/batch`` will wrap in the full §3.2 validation pipeline.  It
does the smallest correct thing and nothing more:

1. **Hash the raw body** — ``event_hash = hash_event(body)`` over the verbatim
   dict (ENG-56 raw-hash discipline).  Here the server *is* the source of truth,
   so the dict passed in is authoritative and stored verbatim.  ``JCSError``
   propagates to the caller.
2. **Assign the sequence** with the §3.1 canonical statement
   ``UPDATE streams SET head_seq = head_seq + 1 WHERE stream_id = :sid
   RETURNING head_seq`` — one atomic statement that takes a row-level write lock
   on the ``streams`` row, so concurrent inserts to the same stream serialize
   into a gapless, monotonic sequence (D2).  A missing row raises
   :class:`UnknownStreamError` (the caller must bootstrap the row first — D4).
3. **Insert the ``events`` row** verbatim (``body`` is the sole hash source).
3b. **Apply to ``messages_proj``** (ENG-69) — ``apply_projection`` materializes the
   incremental projection *in the same transaction* (§4.2 accept ordering: insert
   into ``events`` → apply to ``messages_proj`` → commit).  It runs BEFORE the
   ``Envelope`` is built and does not commit, so a projection failure rolls back
   the ``events`` insert with it — the event is rejected, never stored without its
   projection.  Only ``message.created`` v1 writes a row; every other type is a
   D9 no-op.
4. **Return** the stored :class:`~msgd.core.envelope.Envelope`.

What it deliberately does **NOT** do (ENG-66 owns these): schema validation,
``event_hash`` recompute-and-compare against a client hash, author-matches-session
checks, referential checks, the 64 KB size cap, and **idempotency by**
``event_id``.  It assumes a fresh, server-trusted body — true for both M1 callers
(two server-authored events with freshly minted ``event_id``s).  It **does not
commit** — it runs inside the caller's transaction.
