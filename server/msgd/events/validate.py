"""Per-event validation pipeline for ``POST /v1/events/batch`` (TDD §3.2, ENG-66).

:func:`validate_event` runs the §3.2 checks over one raw upload item and returns
an :class:`Accepted` / :class:`Rejected` outcome. It performs **reads only**
(permission predicate + existence queries); all mutation (``emit_event``) and the
per-event commit happen in the router (D6), so a rejected item never opens a
transaction.

The step order is **locked by §3.2** and load-bearing:

    0. item shape         -> invalid_schema
    ii. workspace + author binding matches the session -> permission_denied
    iii. stream write permission (+ archived-write gate) -> permission_denied
    iv. envelope schema gate, then known-type payload gate -> invalid_schema
    v. hash recompute over the RAW dict -> hash_mismatch (JCS out-of-domain ->
       invalid_schema)
    vi. referential (genesis collision / §2.2 homing / lifecycle existence)
    vii. 64 KB single-event wire-form cap -> payload_too_large

Two rulings baked in here:

* **Raw-faithful hashing (ENG-56):** ``raw_body = item["body"]`` is captured
  verbatim and is the *sole* input to ``hash_event``. The step-iv envelope check
  uses :meth:`Body.model_validate` as a **gate only** — it builds a throwaway
  model to validate required fields + id formats and is discarded; because it
  never mutates ``raw_body``, hashing ``raw_body`` afterward is byte-faithful to
  what the client sent. Lax scalar coercion (``"type_version":"1"`` -> ``1``)
  touches only the throwaway model. We call ``hash_event`` directly, **never**
  ``verify_hash`` — so ``verify_hash``'s server-minted redaction exemption is
  unreachable on the upload path, and a client that smuggles
  ``server.payload_redacted`` cannot waive its own hash check (``item["server"]``
  is never even read).

* **Unknown-type write gate (D9, flagged):** ``can_write`` default-denies any
  type it does not recognize, which would wrongly reject D9 unknown types. So
  known types go through ``can_write`` and **unknown types are gated on read /
  membership access via ``can_read``** instead. Subtle — see ``_WRITE_MATRIX_TYPES``.
