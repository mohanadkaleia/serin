"""Readable-streams predicate + read/write helpers (ENG-65 D5/D6).

:func:`readable_streams_predicate` is the **one shared SQL fragment** reused
verbatim by pull (``/v1/events``, ``/v1/sync``), search (§8), and WS fanout
scoping.  :func:`can_read` / :func:`can_write` are the row-level helpers built on
the *same* predicate (no divergent second implementation).

Rulings baked in (D5):

* **``workspace-meta`` is readable by non-guest members only** (owner/admin/
  member).  Guests see *only* streams with an explicit ``stream_members`` row
  (§3.6).  **FLAGGED DEVIATION** from a naive "workspace-meta readable by every
  member" reading of §2.2: giving guests the meta stream would leak the full
  public-channel + member roster.  This is the precise §3.6 interpretation — a
  guest is a member with restricted scope — but it is a conscious call, and the
  web member-list projection must know guests won't receive meta.
* **Public channels** are readable by every non-guest member without a
  membership row (§3.6: reading a public channel does not require joining).
  Guests need an explicit row (the ``EXISTS`` branch covers them).
* **Private channels + DMs** require a ``stream_members`` row (the ``EXISTS``
  branch) — for *every* role.
* **Archived channels stay readable** (no ``archived_at`` filter — archival gates
  writes/UI, not history access, D13).

Because the private/DM/guest branch is a **live** ``EXISTS`` on
``stream_members``, deleting a member row cuts predicate access on the very next
query — the "removal cuts server-side history access immediately" property (D13).

      author-is-a-participant + genesis/homing rules are enforced in
      ``validate._check_referential`` (which has the payload). Enabled in M3
      (ENG-104); the reducer + predicate were already ready from M1 |
    | ``reaction.added`` / ``reaction.removed`` | any member who can WRITE the
      target message's stream — and a reaction is a write to the same stream the
      message lives in (§2.4), so write access == read access, identical to
      ``message.created`` (ENG-97, M3) |
    | ``message.edited`` / ``message.deleted`` | any member who can WRITE (== read)

      admin** refinement (only the ORIGINAL author or a workspace admin/owner may

      not have, so it is enforced downstream in ``validate._check_referential``
      alongside the ``unknown_message`` existence check (ENG-98, M3) |
    | ``file.uploaded`` | any member who can WRITE (== read) the target stream —
      attaching a file is a write to the stream it is shared into, so the
      stream-level gate is the identical readable-streams predicate, exactly like

      caller belongs to. ``POST /v1/files/initiate`` (ENG-116) is the HTTP surface
      that consults this; the reducer that materializes the ``file.uploaded`` event
      is a later ticket |
