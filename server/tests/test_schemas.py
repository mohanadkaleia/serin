"""Freeze guard for the published JSON Schemas (ENG-62).

``docs/schemas/envelope.schema.json`` and
``docs/schemas/message.created.v1.schema.json`` are the M0 exit-criterion
artifacts the M2 web client and M5 plugin authors consume (§2.2). They are
generated from the Pydantic models by ``server/tests/generate_schemas.py`` and
frozen here: this module regenerates each document in memory and asserts
**byte-equality** to the committed file.

Unlike ``vectors.json`` (data consumed elsewhere, pinned by a SHA constant), a
schema file is self-contained, so a direct string compare is enough — no SHA
needed. Any drift between the models and the committed schemas — including a
pydantic upgrade that changes ``model_json_schema()`` output — fails these tests
until the files are deliberately regenerated and reviewed.

Regenerate with ``uv run python server/tests/generate_schemas.py``.
