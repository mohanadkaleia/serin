"""Apply an op sequence, settle, snapshot server truth, assert all four invariants.

The default driver is **randomized-sequential** (ops applied one at a time in the
hypothesis-drawn order) for CI-reproducible determinism; ``ConcurrentSendBurst`` is
the one op that fans out via ``asyncio.gather`` for the true streams-row-lock probe
(§3).  After the ops, every client reconnects, flushes its outbox, and catches up
(the §3.3 delivery contract); then server truth is read through a fresh committing
session and the four §12-subset invariants are asserted.

Lifecycle (R2): the sim commits real rows, so it starts from a truncated server and
``truncate_auth_tables`` runs in a ``finally`` — the ``test_events_batch_concurrency``
discipline, so committed rows never leak into other integration tests.
