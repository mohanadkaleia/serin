"""World bootstrap — workspace + N members + adversary + public/private channels (§4).

Everything is driven through the **real** endpoints (``/v1/setup``, the invite
flow, ``POST /v1/events/batch``) so the sim exercises the real accept + reducer +
membership-bootstrap path end to end — the whole point of an *acceptance* harness.
A direct DB seed would bypass exactly the permission-bootstrap code the adversary
invariant is meant to prove.

**R1 (verified against ``msgd/events/reducers.py``):** the merged M1 reducer
**does** support ``channel.member_added`` (``_reduce_channel_member_added`` is
registered in ``REDUCERS``; ``can_write`` allows it for owner/admin; ``validate``
homes a private-channel lifecycle event self-homed in the channel's own stream).
So private membership is expressed the natural way — the owner uploads a real
``channel.member_added`` per member.  The genesis creator (owner) is auto-added by
``_reduce_channel_created``.  The adversary is **never** added, either way.

*Simplification (M1 skeleton):* every non-adversary actor joins the private
channel, so any actor may write either stream and the runner stays membership-
agnostic.  Partial private membership (a strict subset) is an M2 strategy seam —
the load-bearing property here is adversary **exclusion**, which holds regardless.
