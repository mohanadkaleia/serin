"""Hypothesis op-generation + the interleaving/concurrency model (§3).

The op union is a small set of frozen dataclasses; a :class:`Plan` is a member
count ``n`` (2–4) plus a bounded list of ops.  ``actor`` indexes the writer list
(owner + invited members, adversary excluded); ``stream`` is ``0`` (public) or
``1`` (private).

**Interleaving model — RULED:** randomized-*sequential* application with occasional
gather-bursts.  The runner applies ops one at a time in the hypothesis-drawn order
(randomized interleaving of client actions, yet deterministic and CI-reproducible
— no wall-clock races).  The *one* op that needs true concurrency —
``ConcurrentSendBurst`` — issues K simultaneous sends to the **same** stream via
``asyncio.gather`` (the ``test_events_batch_concurrency`` pattern), the targeted
streams-row-lock / gaplessness probe.

**Profiles:** ``ci`` = ``derandomize=True`` + bounded ``max_examples`` +
``deadline=None`` (container IO), sized <2 min; ``dev`` = more examples,
non-derandomized.  ``ci`` is selected when ``CI`` is set (the harness threads
``CI: "true"``).  Registered at import so both suite modules pick up the profile.
