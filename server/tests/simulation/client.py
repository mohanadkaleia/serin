"""``SimClient`` — the simulated M2 web client, pull-based (ENG-71 §1).

A library object wrapping **one shared** :class:`httpx.AsyncClient` (the committing
app's client — every ``SimClient`` hits the same in-process server / same
Postgres, so one client's committed upload is visible to another's pull).  It is
**not** an ``msgctl`` subprocess.

State model — the exact contract §3.3 pins for the real web client, so the M2
SharedWorker/Dexie outbox is *this* object with a different transport:

* **cursors are truth** — ``cursors[stream]`` is the last-contiguous
  ``server_sequence`` this client has pulled; it is advanced **only** by
  :meth:`catchup_pull`, never derived from an upload ack or a (future) WS frame.
* **the outbox is a dumb idempotent retry loop** — :meth:`flush` re-POSTs the
  whole outbox; the server's ``UNIQUE(workspace_id, event_id)`` makes re-sends
  safe; an item leaves the outbox only when the server returns its ``event_id`` in
  ``accepted[]``.  The ``event_id`` is minted **once** in :meth:`send` and is
  stable across every retry — that is what makes idempotency real.
* the client trusts nothing but a pulled, sequenced event.

No WebSocket in the M1 skeleton — pull only (WS is an ENG-68 transport seam that
rides the same cursor-truth state model, not a rewrite).
