# `docker compose exec app msgctl …` (TDD §11 acceptance criterion).

# Copy the workspace source needed to resolve + build. `github-notifier`
# (plugins/) is an OUT-OF-PROCESS external plugin (D12): it must NOT ship inside
# the runtime image, but it IS a workspace member (so the repo-root ruff/mypy/
# pytest gates cover it), and `[tool.uv.sources]` maps it to the workspace — so
# uv must still SEE its directory at resolve time or the locked sync aborts with
# "references a workspace ... but is not a workspace member". Its source is
# copied into the builder ONLY (never into the runtime stage below) and is
# excluded from the venv install just below, so nothing plugin-related crosses
# the stage boundary. `--no-editable` builds real wheels, so msgd + msgctl source
# must be present.

# --no-dev  drops the pytest/mypy/testcontainers group (never ships).
# --no-editable installs msgd + msgctl as built wheels (not .pth shims), so the
#   runtime venv is self-contained and independent of the source tree; the
#   msgctl console script lands at /app/.venv/bin/msgctl.
# --no-install-package github-notifier / serin-sdk  resolves each plugin as a
#   workspace member (keeping --locked honest) but keeps its wheel OUT of
#   /app/.venv, so the runtime image stays plugin-free (D12 — plugins run as
#   their own processes; serin-sdk is a client library, not a server component).
# --locked  fails if uv.lock is stale (reproducible builds).

# and the CI `web` job (Corepack-activated pnpm on Node 22).
