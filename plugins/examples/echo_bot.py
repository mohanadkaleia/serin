"""A minimal echo bot for Serin, built on the serin_sdk.

It listens in every channel the bot has been granted and replies to each message
by echoing it back — skipping its own messages so it never talks to itself.

Run it (as a workspace owner/admin, do steps 1-2 in the web UI first):

  1. Admin -> Apps -> Bots -> "Create bot": grant it the channel(s) to watch and
     the scopes ``events:read`` + ``events:write``. Then mint a token (shown once).
  2. Install the SDK with the live-stream extra:
         pip install "serin-sdk[ws]"
  3. Run this file with the server URL and that token:
         MSG_BASE_URL=https://msg.example.com \
         MSG_BOT_TOKEN=<the token from step 1> \
         python echo_bot.py
