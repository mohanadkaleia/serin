"""``msgctl verify`` — independent, read-only re-derivation of the M0 log invariants.

``verify`` walks a workspace's log tree and re-proves, from the bytes on disk alone,
the two promises ``send`` made (ENG-60, TDD §9 / §11.4):

1.  **Hash faithfulness (D1):** for every event in every stream, recompute
    ``event_hash`` = SHA-256 over the JCS canonicalization of the **raw stored body**
    and compare it to the stored ``event_hash`` string. A mismatch is exactly the
    tampering the hash exists to catch — a flipped body byte, or a payload edited
    without re-hashing.
2.  **Sequence integrity (D2):** per-stream ``server_sequence`` is gapless from 1, has
    no duplicates, and is monotonic across month files.

Plus per-event envelope schema validation (known types validated against the payload
registry; unknown types get hash + sequence + envelope-shape checks only — D9) and a
set of workspace-level cross-checks (registry vs. on-disk stream dirs, ``body``'s
``workspace_id`` vs. the manifest).

Discipline this module is built to keep
--------------------------------------
* **Read-only, always (Ruling 1).** verify has its OWN walk; it never reuses
  ``append.py``'s scan. It opens every month file with ``read_bytes()`` and NEVER
  truncates, fsyncs, repairs, or otherwise mutates the disk — a torn trailing line is
  *reported* (a warning), never fixed. Every anomaly becomes a :class:`Finding`; nothing
  raises mid-walk. verify takes no lock (it is safe to run against a live workspace; a
  concurrent ``send`` at worst yields a benign ``torn_line`` warning).
* **``streams/**/*.ndjson`` ONLY (Ruling 2, the ENG-58 anti-collision boundary).** File
  discovery is exactly ``streams/<stream_id>/*.ndjson`` plus ``workspace.json``. verify
  reads NOTHING else at the workspace root — in particular it ignores
  ``projections.sqlite3`` (which ENG-58 places at the root) and any lock/temp/WAL
  sidecar. A ``.ndjson`` directly under ``streams/`` (not inside a ``<stream_id>/``
  subdir) is not a stream log and is ignored (verbose note only).
* **Raw-hash authority (Ruling 2, non-negotiable).** The hash check calls
  ``hash_event(raw["body"])`` on the pre-model parsed dict and compares to the raw
  stored ``event_hash`` string. ``verify_hash(envelope)`` is FORBIDDEN here — see the
  comment on Pass A. Schema validation is a SEPARATE, additive pass whose result never
  feeds the hash check. **No redaction waiver at M0 (security round 1):** the plan's
  ``payload_redacted`` exemption is withdrawn — redaction does not exist at M0, so the
  self-asserted flag has no authority; the hash check runs unconditionally and a truthy
  flag is itself a FAILURE (``redacted_line``). The §2.1 exemption returns at M1 only
  for authenticated, audited server redactions validated against their audit record.
* **TTY-safe human output.** Untrusted strings (stored hashes, dir/file names, manifest
  stream names, event types) are escaped (C0/C1/DEL → visible ``\\xNN``) at the
  ``format_human`` boundary only — ESC enables ANSI rewriting and CR enables line
  overwrite, and the human report is the operator's decision surface. ``Finding``
  values stay raw so ``--json`` keeps byte-fidelity (``json.dumps`` escapes control
  characters itself).
* **Collect everything (Ruling 8).** verify never stops at the first finding; it walks
  every stream, month, and line, then prints and exits. Human output is capped at
  :data:`MAX_HUMAN_FINDINGS` detail lines (summary counts stay complete); ``--json`` is
  uncapped.

Exit codes (CI contract): ``0`` clean or warnings-only, ``1`` any failure, ``2``
usage/IO (not a workspace, unreadable path).

Blob re-hashing (§9 "re-hashes every blob") is **out of scope until M4** — an M0
workspace has no ``blobs/`` tree (ENG-57 §9 subset). The ``# M4 SEAM:`` marker in
:func:`verify_workspace` is the documented slot where M4's ``_verify_blobs`` pass (with
its own ``blob_missing`` / ``blob_hash_mismatch`` classes) will attach without touching
the stream walk.
