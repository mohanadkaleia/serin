"""The crash-safe, idempotent NDJSON append engine (Rulings 2–4).

``msgctl send`` is the M0 stand-in for the M1 sync server's sequencer. This
module owns the critical section that makes that honest:

- **Scan-on-open** (Ruling 3): the log *is* the source of truth. On entering a
  stream's critical section we re-derive the next ``server_sequence`` and the set
  of accepted ``event_id``s by scanning every month file. There is no sidecar
  counter to drift across restarts.
- **Torn-write safety** (Ruling 3): a line is *accepted* only if newline-
  terminated. A crashed partial trailing write is truncated on open (with a
  stderr warning); its would-be sequence is simply reused, so no gap appears.
- **Idempotency** (§3.2): a repeated ``event_id`` is a no-op that returns the
  original stored line and consumes no sequence.
- **Locking** (Ruling 4): an ``fcntl.flock`` exclusive lock serializes the whole
  scan→check→append per stream so two racing processes never fork a sequence.

POSIX-only: ``fcntl.flock`` is unavailable on Windows, which is out of scope for
M0 (Linux server image + macOS dev). The ``.lock`` files are advisory and left
in place harmlessly.
